                                                    We present SegFormer, a simple, efficient yet powerful semantic segmentation
                                                    framework which unifies Transformers with lightweight multilayer perceptron
                                                    (MLP) decoders. SegFormer has two appealing features: 1) SegFormer comprises
                                                    a novel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale
                                                    features. It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the interpolation of
                                                    positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the testing resolution
                                                    differs from training. 2) SegFormer avoids complex decoders. The proposed
                                                    MLP decoder aggregates information from different layers, and thus combining
                                                    both local attention and global attention to render powerful representations. We
                                                    show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to efficient segmentation
                                                    on Transformers. We scale our approach up to obtain a series of models from
                                                    SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5, reaching significantly better performance and
                                                    efficiency than previous counterparts. For example, SegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3%
                                                    mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters, being 5× smaller and 2.2% better than
                                                    the previous best method. Our best model, SegFormer-B5, achieves 84.0% mIoU on
                                                    Cityscapes validation set and shows excellent zero-shot robustness on Cityscapes-C.

semantic segmentation. Besides backbone architectures, another line of work formulates semantic
segmentation as a structured prediction problem, and focuses on designing modules and operators,
which can effectively capture contextual information. A representative example in this area is dilated
convolution [4, 5], which increases the receptive field by “inflating” the kernel with holes.
Witnessing the great success in natural language processing (NLP), there has been a recent surge of
interest to introduce Transformers to vision tasks. Dosovitskiy et al. [6] proposed vision Transformer
(ViT) for image classification. Following the Transformer design in NLP, the authors split an image
into multiple linearly embedded patches and feed them into a standard Transformer with positional
embeddings (PE), leading to an impressive performance on ImageNet. In semantic segmentation,
Zheng et al. [7] proposed SETR to demonstrate the feasibility of using Transformers in this task.
SETR adopts ViT as a backbone and incorporates several CNN decoders to enlarge feature resolution.
Despite the good performance, ViT has some limitations: 1) ViT outputs single-scale low-resolution
features instead of multi-scale ones. 2) It has high computation cost on large images. To address these
limitations, Wang et al. [8] proposed a pyramid vision Transformer (PVT), a natural extension of ViT
with pyramid structures for dense prediction. PVT shows considerable improvements over the ResNet
counterpart on object detection and semantic segmentation. However, together with other emerging
methods such as Swin Transformer [9] and Twins [10], these methods mainly consider the design of
the Transformer encoder, neglecting the contribution of the decoder for further improvements.
This paper introduces SegFormer, a cutting-edge Transformer framework for semantic segmentation
that jointly considers efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. In contrast to previous methods, our
framework redesigns both the encoder and the decoder. The key novelties of our approach are:

• A novel positional-encoding-free and hierarchical Transformer encoder.
• A lightweight All-MLP decoder design that yields a powerful representation without complex and
  computationally demanding modules.
• As shown in Figure 1, SegFormer sets new a state-of-the-art in terms of efficiency, accuracy and
  robustness in three publicly available semantic segmentation datasets.

First, the proposed encoder avoids interpolating positional codes when performing inference on
images with resolutions different from the training one. As a result, our encoder can easily adapt to
arbitrary test resolutions without impacting the performance. In addition, the hierarchical part enables
the encoder to generate both high-resolution fine features and low-resolution coarse features, this is
in contrast to ViT that can only produce single low-resolution feature maps with fixed resolutions.
Second, we propose a lightweight MLP decoder where the key idea is to take advantage of the
Transformer-induced features where the attentions of lower layers tend to stay local, whereas the
ones of the highest layers are highly non-local. By aggregating the information from different layers,
the MLP decoder combines both local and global attention. As a result, we obtain a simple and
straightforward decoder that renders powerful representations.
We demonstrate the advantages of SegFormer in terms of model size, run-time, and accuracy on three
publicly available datasets: ADE20K, Cityscapes, and COCO-Stuff. On Citysapces, our lightweight
model, SegFormer-B0, without accelerated implementations such as TensorRT, yields 71.9% mIoU
at 48 FPS, which, compared to ICNet [11], represents a relative improvement of 60% and 4.2% in
latency and performance, respectively. Our largest model, SegFormer-B5, yields 84.0% mIoU, which
represents a relative 1.8% mIoU improvement while being 5 × faster than SETR [7]. On ADE20K,
this model sets a new state-of-the-art of 51.8% mIoU while being 4 × smaller than SETR. Moreover,
our approach is significantly more robust to common corruptions and perturbations than existing
methods, therefore being suitable for safety-critical applications. Code will be publicly available.

Semantic Segmentation. Semantic segmentation can be seen as an extension of image classification
from image level to pixel level. In the deep learning era [12–16], FCN [1] is the fundamental work of
semantic segmentation, which is a fully convolution network that performs pixel-to-pixel classification
in an end-to-end manner. After that, researchers focused on improving FCN from different aspects
such as: enlarging the receptive field [17–19, 5, 2, 4, 20]; refining the contextual information [21–

29]; introducing boundary information [30–37]; designing various attention modules [38–46]; or
using AutoML technologies [47–51]. These methods significantly improve semantic segmentation
performance at the expense of introducing many empirical modules, making the resulting framework
computationally demanding and complicated. More recent methods have proved the effectiveness of
Transformer-based architectures for semantic segmentation [7, 46]. However, these methods are still
computationally demanding.
Transformer backbones. ViT [6] is the first work to prove that a pure Transformer can achieve
state-of-the-art performance in image classification. ViT treats each image as a sequence of tokens and
then feeds them to multiple Transformer layers to make the classification. Subsequently, DeiT [52]
further explores a data-efficient training strategy and a distillation approach for ViT. More recent
methods such as T2T ViT [53], CPVT [54], TNT [55], CrossViT [56] and LocalViT [57] introduce
tailored changes to ViT to further improve image classification performance.
Beyond classification, PVT [8] is the first work to introduce a pyramid structure in Transformer,
demonstrating the potential of a pure Transformer backbone compared to CNN counterparts in
dense prediction tasks. After that, methods such as Swin [9], CvT [58], CoaT [59], LeViT [60] and
Twins [10] enhance the local continuity of features and remove fixed size position embedding to
improve the performance of Transformers in dense prediction tasks.
Transformers for specific tasks. DETR [52] is the first work using Transformers to build an end-to-
end object detection framework without non-maximum suppression (NMS). Other works have also
used Transformers in a variety of tasks such as tracking [61, 62], super-resolution [63], ReID [64],
Colorization [65], Retrieval [66] and multi-modal learning [67, 68]. For semantic segmentation,
SETR [7] adopts ViT [6] as a backbone to extract features, achieving impressive performance.
However, these Transformer-based methods have very low efficiency and, thus, difficult to deploy in
real-time applications.

3    Method

This section introduces SegFormer, our efficient, robust, and powerful segmentation framework
without hand-crafted and computationally demanding modules. As depicted in Figure 2, SegFormer
consists of two main modules: (1) a hierarchical Transformer encoder to generate high-resolution
coarse features and low-resolution fine features; and (2) a lightweight All-MLP decoder to fuse these
multi-level features to produce the final semantic segmentation mask.
Given an image of size H × W × 3, we first divide it into patches of size 4 × 4. Contrary to ViT
that uses patches of size 16 × 16, using smaller patches favors the dense prediction task. We then
use these patches as input to the hierarchical Transformer encoder to obtain multi-level features at
{1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32} of the original image resolution. We then pass these multi-level features to the
All-MLP decoder to predict the segmentation mask at a H       W
                                                          4 × 4 × Ncls resolution, where Ncls is the

                                                                                                         3
number of categories. In the rest of this section, we detail the proposed encoder and decoder designs
and summarize the main differences between our approach and SETR.

3.1   Hierarchical Transformer Encoder

We design a series of Mix Transformer encoders (MiT), MiT-B0 to MiT-B5, with the same architecture
but different sizes. MiT-B0 is our lightweight model for fast inference, while MiT-B5 is the largest
model for the best performance. Our design for MiT is partly inspired by ViT but tailored and
optimized for semantic segmentation.
Hierarchical Feature Representation. Unlike ViT that can only generate a single-resolution feature
map, the goal of this module is, given an input image, to generate CNN-like multi-level features.
These features provide high-resolution coarse features and low-resolution fine-grained features that
usually boost the performance of semantic segmentation. More precisely, given an input image with
a resolution of H × W × 3, we perform patch merging to obtain a hierarchical feature map Fi with a
                H
resolution of 2i+1 × 2Wi+1 × Ci , where i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}, and Ci+1 is larger than Ci .

Overlapped Patch Merging. Given an image patch, the patch merging process used in ViT, unifies
a N × N × 3 patch into a 1 × 1 × C vector. This can easily be extended to unify a 2 × 2 × Ci
feature path into a 1 × 1 × Ci+1 vector to obtain hierarchical feature maps. Using this, we can shrink
our hierarchical features from F1 ( H      W                 H     W
                                      4 × 4 × C1 ) to F2 ( 8 × 8 × C2 ), and then iterate for any
other feature map in the hierarchy. This process was initially designed to combine non-overlapping
image or feature patches. Therefore, it fails to preserve the local continuity around those patches.
Instead, we use an overlapping patch merging process. To this end, we define K, S, and P , where
K is the patch size, S is the stride between two adjacent patches, and P is the padding size. In our
experiments, we set K = 7, S = 4, P = 3 ,and K = 3, S = 2, P = 1 to perform overlapping patch
merging to produces features with the same size as the non-overlapping process.
Efficient Self-Attention. The main computation bottleneck of the encoders is the self-attention layer.
In the original multi-head self-attention process, each of the heads Q, K, V have the same dimensions
N × C, where N = H × W is the length of the sequence, the self-attention is estimated as:
                                                          QK T
                           Attention(Q, K, V ) = Softmax( √       )V.                             (1)
                                                            dhead
The computational complexity of this process is O(N 2 ), which is prohibitive for large image
resolutions. Instead, we use the sequence reduction process introduced in [8]. This process uses a
reduction ratio R to reduce the length of the sequence of as follows:
                                                N
                                   K̂ = Reshape(   , C · R)(K)
                                                R                                                 (2)
                                   K = Linear(C · R, C)(K̂),
where K is the sequence to be reduced, Reshape( NR , C · R)(K) refers to reshape K to the one with
         N
shape of R × (C · R), and Linear(Cin , Cout )(·) refers to a linear layer taking a Cin -dimensional
tensor as input and generating a Cout -dimensional tensor as output. Therefore, the new K has
dimensions N R × C. As a result, the complexity of the self-attention mechanism is reduced from
               2
O(N ) to O( NR ). In our experiments, we set R to [64, 16, 4, 1] from stage-1 to stage-4.

Mix-FFN. ViT uses positional encoding (PE) to introduce the location information. However, the
resolution of PE is fixed. Therefore, when the test resolution is different from the training one, the
positional code needs to be interpolated and this often leads to dropped accuracy. To alleviate this
problem, CPVT [54] uses 3 × 3 Conv together with the PE to implement a data-driven PE. We argue
that positional encoding is actually not necessary for semantic segmentation. Instead, we introduce
Mix-FFN which considers the effect of zero padding to leak location information [69], by directly
using a 3 × 3 Conv in the feed-forward network (FFN). Mix-FFN can be formulated as:
                        xout = MLP(GELU(Conv3×3 (MLP(xin )))) + xin ,                             (3)
where xin is the feature from the self-attention module. Mix-FFN mixes a 3 × 3 convolution and
an MLP into each FFN. In our experiments, we will show that a 3 × 3 convolution is sufficient to
provide positional information for Transformers. In particular, we use depth-wise convolutions for
reducing the number of parameters and improving efficiency.

3.2   Lightweight All-MLP Decoder

SegFormer incorporates a lightweight decoder consisting only of MLP layers and this avoiding the
hand-crafted and computationally demanding components typically used in other methods. The key
to enabling such a simple decoder is that our hierarchical Transformer encoder has a larger effective
receptive field (ERF) than traditional CNN encoders.
The proposed All-MLP decoder consists of four main steps. First, multi-level features Fi from
the MiT encoder go through an MLP layer to unify the channel dimension. Then, in a second
step, features are up-sampled to 1/4th and concatenated together. Third, a MLP layer is adopted to
fuse the concatenated features F . Finally, another MLP layer takes the fused feature to predict the
segmentation mask M with a H         W
                                4 × 4 × Ncls resolution, where Ncls is the number of categories.
This lets us formulate the decoder as:
                                  F̂i = Linear(Ci , C)(Fi ), ∀i
                                                    W     W
                                  F̂i = Upsample(      ×      )(F̂i ), ∀i
                                                    4      4                                                          (4)
                                  F = Linear(4C, C)(Concat(F̂i )), ∀i
                                  M = Linear(C, Ncls )(F ),
where M refers to the predicted mask, and Linear(Cin , Cout )(·) refers to a linear layer with Cin and
Cout as input and output vector dimensions respectively.

ing large receptive field to include con-
text information has been a central is-
sue [5, 19, 20]. Here, we use effec-
tive receptive field (ERF) [70] as a
toolkit to visualize and interpret why
our MLP decoder design is so effec-
tive on Transformers. In Figure 3, we

make the following observations:
• The ERF of DeepLabv3+ is relatively small even at Stage-4, the deepest stage.
• SegFormer’s encoder naturally produces local attentions which resemble convolutions at lower
  stages, while able to output highly non-local attentions that effectively capture contexts at Stage-4.
• As shown with the zoom-in patches in Figure 3, the ERF of the MLP head (blue box) differs from
  Stage-4 (red box) with a significant stronger local attention besides the non-local attention.

The limited receptive field in CNN requires one to resort to context modules such as ASPP [18]
that enlarge the receptive field but inevitably become heavy. Our decoder design benefits from the
non-local attention in Transformers and leads to a larger receptive field without being complex. The
same decoder design, however, does not work well on CNN backbones since the overall receptive
field is upper bounded by the limited one at Stage-4, and we will verify this later in Table 1d,
More importantly, our decoder design essentially takes advantage of a Transformer induced feature
that produces both highly local and non-local attention at the same time. By unifying them, our MLP
decoder renders complementary and powerful representations by adding few parameters. This is
another key reason that motivated our design. Taking the non-local attention from Stage-4 alone is
not enough to produce good results, as will be verified in Table 1d.

3.3   Relationship to SETR.

SegFormer contains multiple more efficient and powerful designs compared with SETR [7]:
• We only use ImageNet-1K for pre-training. ViT in SETR is pre-trained on larger ImageNet-22K.

                                                                             5
• SegFormer’s encoder has a hierarchical architecture, which is smaller than ViT and can capture
  both high-resolution coarse and low-resolution fine features. In contrast, SETR’s ViT encoder can
  only generate single low-resolution feature map.
• We remove Positional Embedding in encoder, while SETR uses fixed shape Positional Embedding
  which decreases the accuracy when the resolution at inference differs from the training ones.
• Our MLP decoder is more compact and less computationally demanding than the one in SETR.
  This leads to a negligible computational overhead. In contrast, SETR requires heavy decoders with
  multiple 3×3 convolutions.

4         Experiments

4.1        Experimental Settings

Datasets: We used three publicly available datasets: Cityscapes [71], ADE20K [72] and COCO-
Stuff [73]. ADE20K is a scene parsing dataset covering 150 fine-grained semantic concepts consisting
of 20210 images. Cityscapes is a driving dataset for semantic segmentation consisting of 5000 fine-
annotated high resolution images with 19 categories. COCO-Stuff covers 172 labels and consists of
164k images: 118k for training, 5k for validation, 20k for test-dev and 20k for the test-challenge.
Implementation details: We used the mmsegmentation1 codebase and train on a server with 8 Tesla
V100. We pre-train the encoder on the Imagenet-1K dataset and randomly initialize the decoder.
During training, we applied data augmentation through random resize with ratio 0.5-2.0, random
horizontal flipping, and random cropping to 512 × 512, 1024×1024, 512 × 512 for ADE20K,
Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff, respectively. Following [9] we set crop size to 640 × 640 on ADE20K
for our largest model B5. We trained the models using AdamW optimizer for 160K iterations on
ADE20K, Cityscapes, and 80K iterations on COCO-Stuff. Exceptionally, for the ablation studies, we
trained the models for 40K iterations. We used a batch size of 16 for ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, and
a batch size of 8 for Cityscapes. The learning rate was set to an initial value of 0.00006 and then used
a “poly” LR schedule with factor 1.0 by default. For simplicity, we did not adopt widely-used tricks
such as OHEM, auxiliary losses or class balance loss. During evaluation, we rescale the short side
of the image to training cropping size and keep the aspect ratio for ADE20K and COCO-Stuff. For
Cityscapes, we do inference using sliding window test by cropping 1024 × 1024 windows. We report
semantic segmentation performance using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).

4.2        Ablation Studies

Influence of the size of model. We first analyze the effect of increasing the size of the encoder on
the performance and model efficiency. Figure 1 shows the performance vs. model efficiency for
ADE20K as a function of the encoder size and, Table 1a summarizes the results for the three datasets.
The first thing to observe here is the size of the decoder compared to the encoder. As shown, for
the lightweight model, the decoder has only 0.4M parameters. For MiT-B5 encoder, the decoder
only takes up to 4% of the total number of parameters in the model. In terms of performance, we
can observe that, overall, increasing the size of the encoder yields consistent improvements on all
the datasets. Our lightweight model, SegFormer-B0, is compact and efficient while maintaining a
competitive performance, showing that our method is very convenient for real-time applications. On
the other hand, our SegFormer-B5, the largest model, achieves state-of-the-art results on all three
datasets, showing the potential of our Transformer encoder.
Influence of C, the MLP decoder channel dimension. We now analyze the influence of the channel
dimension C in the MLP decoder, see Section 3.2. In Table 1b we show performance, flops, and
parameters as a function of this dimension. We can observe that setting C = 256 provides a
very competitive performance and computational cost. The performance increases as C increases;
however, it leads to larger and less efficient models. Interestingly, this performance plateaus for
channel dimensions wider than 768. Given these results, we choose C = 256 for our real-time
models SegFormer-B0, B1 and C = 768 for the rest.

Mix-FFN vs. Positional Encoder (PE). In this experiment, we analyze the effect of removing the
positional encoding in the Transformer encoder in favor of using the proposed Mix-FFN. To this
end, we train Transformer encoders with a positional encoding (PE) and the proposed Mix-FFN
and perform inference on Cityscapes with two different image resolutions: 768×768 using a sliding
window, and 1024×2048 using the whole image.
Table 1c shows the results for this experiment. As shown, for a given resolution, our approach using
Mix-FFN clearly outperforms using a positional encoding. Moreover, our approach is less sensitive
to differences in the test resolution: the accuracy drops 3.3% when using a positional encoding with a
lower resolution. In contrast, when we use the proposed Mix-FFN the performance drop is reduced
to only 0.7%. From these results, we can conclude using the proposed Mix-FFN produces better and
more robust encoders than those using positional encoding.
Effective receptive field evaluation. In Section 3.2, we argued that our MLP decoder benefits
from Transformers having a larger effective receptive field compared to other CNN models. To
quantify this effect, in this experiment, we compare the performance of our MLP-decoder when
used with CNN-based encoders such as ResNet or ResNeXt. As shown in Table 1d, coupling our

                                                                           7
MLP-decoder with a CNN-based encoder yields a significantly lower accuracy compared to coupling
it with the proposed Transformer encoder. Intuitively, as a CNN has a smaller receptive field than the
Transformer (see the analysis in Section 3.2), the MLP-decoder is not enough for global reasoning.
In contrast, coupling our Transformer encoder with the MLP decoder leads to the best performance.
Moreover, for Transformer encoder, it is necessary to combine low-level local features and high-level
non-local features instead of only high-level feature.

4.3   Comparison to state of the art methods

We now compare our results with existing approaches on the ADE20K [72], Cityscapes [71] and
COCO-Stuff [73] datasets.
ADE20K and Cityscapes: Table 2 summarizes our results including parameters, FLOPS, latency,
and accuracy for ADE20K and Cityscapes. In the top part of the table, we report real-time approaches
where we include state-of-the-art methods and our results using the MiT-B0 lightweight encoder. In
the bottom part, we focus on performance and report the results of our approach and related works
using stronger encoders.
As shown, on ADE20K, SegFormer-B0 yields 37.4% mIoU using only 3.8M parameters and 8.4G
FLOPs, outperforming all other real-time counterparts in terms of parameters, flops, and latency. For
instance, compared to DeeplabV3+ (MobileNetV2), SegFormer-B0 is 7.4 FPS, which is faster and
keeps 3.4% better mIoU. Moreover, SegFormer-B5 outperforms all other approaches, including the
previous best SETR, and establishes a new state-of-the-art of 51.8%, which is 1.6% mIoU better than
SETR while being significantly more efficient.

As reported in Table 3, using only Cityscapes fine data and Imagenet-1K pre-training, our method

4.4   Robustness to natural corruptions

experiment, we evaluate the robustness of SegFormer to common corruptions and perturbations. To

this end, we follow [77] and generate Cityscapes-C, which expands the Cityscapes validation set with
16 types of algorithmically generated corruptions from noise, blur, weather and digital categories. We
compare our method to variants of DeeplabV3+ and other methods as reported in [77]. The results
for this experiment are summarized in Table 5.
Our method significantly outperforms previous methods, yielding a relative improvement of up to
588% on Gaussian Noise and up to 295% on snow weather. The results indicate the strong robustness
of SegFormer, which we envision to benefit safety-critical applications where robustness is important.

5      Conclusion
In this paper, we present SegFormer, a simple, clean yet powerful semantic segmentation method
which contains a positional-encoding-free, hierarchical Transformer encoder and a lightweight All-
MLP decoder. It avoids common complex designs in previous methods, leading to both high efficiency
and performance. SegFormer not only achieves new state of the art results on common datasets,
but also shows strong zero-shot robustness. We hope our method can serve as a solid baseline for
semantic segmentation and motivate further research. One limitation is that although our smallest
3.7M parameters model is smaller than the known CNN’s model, it is unclear whether it can work
well in a chip of edge device with only 100k memory. We leave it for future work.

A      Details of MiT Series
In this section, we list some important hyper-parameters of our Mix Transformer (MiT) encoder. By
changing these parameters, we can easily scale up our encoder from B0 to B5.
In summary, the hyper-parameters of our MiT are listed as follows:

         • Ki : the patch size of the overlapping patch embedding in Stage i;

                                                                  9
       • Si : the stride of the overlapping patch embedding in Stage i;
       • Pi : the padding size of the overlapping patch embedding in Stage i;
       • Ci : the channel number of the output of Stage i;
       • Li : the number of encoder layers in Stage i;
       • Ri : the reduction ratio of the Efficient Self-Attention in Stage i;
       • Ni : the head number of the Efficient Self-Attention in Stage i;
       • Ei : the expansion ratio of the feed-forward layer [78] in Stage i;

Table 6 shows the detailed information of our MiT series. To facilitate efficient discussion, we assign
the code name B0 to B5 for MiT encoder, where B0 is the smallest model designed for real-time,
while B5 is the largest model designed for high performance.

B    More Qualitative Results on Mask Predictions
In Figure 5, we present more qualitative results on Cityscapes, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, compared
with SETR and DeepLabV3+.
Compared to SETR, our SegFormer predicts masks with significantly finer details near object
boundaries because our Transformer encoder can capture much higher resolution features than
SETR, which preserves more detailed texture information. Compared to DeepLabV3+, SegFormer
reduces long-range errors benefit from the larger effective receptive field of Transformer encoder than
ConvNet.

C    More Visualization on Effective Receptive Field
In Figure 6, we select some representative images and effective receptive field (ERF) of DeepLabV3+
and SegFormer. Beyond larger ERF, the ERF of SegFormer is more sensitive to the context of
the image. We see SegFormer’s ERF learned the pattern of roads, cars, and buildings, while
DeepLabV3+’s ERF shows a relatively fixed pattern. The results also indicate that our Transformer
encoder has a stronger feature extraction ability than ConvNets.

D    More Comparison of DeeplabV3+ and SegFormer on Cityscapes-C
In this section, we detailed show the zero-shot robustness compared with SegFormer and DeepLabV3+.
Following [77], we test 3 severities for 4 kinds of “Noise” and 5 severities for the rest 12 kinds of
corruptions and perturbations.
As shown in Figure 7, with severity increase, DeepLabV3+ shows a considerable performance
degradation. In contrast, the performance of SegFormer is relatively stable. Moreover, SegFormer
has significant advantages over DeepLabV3+ on all corruptions/perturbations and all severities,
demonstrating excellent zero-shot robustness.
