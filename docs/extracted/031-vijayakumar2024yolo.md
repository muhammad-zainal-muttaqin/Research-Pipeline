Abstract
In computer vision, object detection is the classical and most challenging problem to get
accurate results in detecting objects. With the significant advancement of deep learning
techniques over the past decades, most researchers work on enhancing object detection,
segmentation and classification. Object detection performance is measured in both detec-
tion accuracy and inference time. The detection accuracy in two stage detectors is better
than single stage detectors. In 2015, the real-time object detection system YOLO was pub-
lished, and it rapidly grew its iterations, with the newest release, YOLOv8 in January 2023.
The YOLO achieves a high detection accuracy and inference time with single stage detec-
tor. Many applications easily adopt YOLO versions due to their high inference speed. This
paper presents a complete survey of YOLO versions up to YOLOv8. This article begins
with explained about the performance metrics used in object detection, post-processing
methods, dataset availability and object detection techniques that are used mostly; then dis-
cusses the architectural design of each YOLO version. Finally, the diverse range of YOLO
versions was discussed by highlighting their contributions to various applications.

1 Introduction

YOLO (You Only Look Once) has become a central object detection model that mostly
works in real-time environments with impressive accuracy and speed. In recent years,
object detection has been a prominent task in CV (Computer Vision) [1] for reliable loca-
tion and identification of objects within video or image. In many applications, such as
defect detection in manufacturing, self-driving cars, surveillance and augmented reality,
object detection plays a very important role.

   Object detection is a vital component in the area of computer vision research, leveraging
the computational power of computers to mimic human vision, identify object categories,
and mark their locations [2]. Over the past few years, there has been notable advancement
in object detection algorithms, particularly those employing deep convolutional neural net-
works (CNN), leading to a gradual shift away from conventional object detection meth-
ods such as Viola Jones detector, HOG and DPM. There are two types of object detection
algorithms depending on how often a network passes the same input image, i.e., single
stage detectors and two stage detectors. [2] Single stage detectors concentrate on all possi-
ble spatial regions for object detection using comparatively simpler architecture in a single
shot. While the two stage detectors primarily use two passes and sophisticated architecture
to propose strategies for specific regions. Nowadays, the object detection algorithm used
in different applications has evolved significantly, with a particular emphasis on enhanc-
ing efficiency and accuracy. State-of-the-art models, such as YOLO and Faster R-CNN
(Region-based Convolutional Neural Network), are widely employed to provide real-time
and robust object detection capabilities. These algorithms find extensive applications in
various domains, including autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, smart cities, and
healthcare, showcasing their versatility and effectiveness in addressing diverse visual rec-
ognition challenges.
   Traditional object detection models often faced limitations in terms of speed, as they
required multiple passes over an image to identify objects. This approach, known as
region-based methods, was computationally intensive and hindered real-time applications.
In contrast, YOLO, with its unique one-shot detection approach, significantly improved
the speed of object detection. Dividing the entire image into a small grid and making a
predictions directly within every grid cell, YOLO achieved impressive real-time process-
ing capabilities, making it particularly advantageous for applications requiring swift and
accurate identification of objects in dynamic environments [4]. The YOLO family has been
subjected to several repetitions since its launch, each improving on the previous iterations
to solve detection issues and improve performance. This review focuses on providing a
detailed review of all versions of YOLO, from YOLOv1 to the newly released version
YOLOv8, demonstrating the main improvements, modifications and innovations made in
each version.
   At first, this paper focuses on addressing the fundamental concepts and architecture
model of every version of YOLO specifying the improvements made on the previous ver-
sions. These variations include anchor box to bounding box, network model design, loss
value calculations, model scaling, labeling methods and aggregation techniques. After dis-
cussing these developments, this review expresses how the YOLO versions work on dif-
ferent applications. Finally, this survey will ensure which YOLO version is suitable and
effective for the specific applications Fig. 1.

1.1 Computer vision tasks

• Object classification specifies any number of class objects in an image, and label
  assignment of each object is done in an image [3].
• Object localization identifies the location of objects in an image or video by enclosing
  each object within a bounding box [3].
• Object detection combines object localization and object classification to recognize and
  locate objects in videos or images [4]

• Object recognition is a process that gives an input image to the model, first it finds the
  objects, then label assignment is done to each class object and gives the likelihood of a
  recognized object in the class [5]

1.2 Object detection benefits

• In a working environment, Biometric verification is a crucial tool for establishing indi-
  vidual identity and enhancing security measures. It employs a variety of biological
  characteristics, such as retinal patterns, fingerprints, facial features, and ear structures,
  to perform the authentication process [5, 8].
• Maintaining a watchful eye over public spaces, industrial premises, and residential
  areas is crucial for ensuring safety and security. This entails implementing compre-
  hensive monitoring systems, i.e., video surveillance cameras, that operate in real-time,
  providing a continuous stream of data and insights into the activities and movements
  within these areas [7, 8].
• Accurate inventory tracking and management made possible by object detection is rev-
  olutionizing retail operations. Products on shelves can be recognized and counted by
  systems, which can also track stock levels and identify inconsistencies or out-of-stock
  circumstances. Inventory management is optimized, efficiency is increased, and losses
  are decreased thanks to automation [9].
• Medical imaging is being revolutionized by object detection, which makes it possible
  to automatically analyze and identify abnormalities in MRIs, CT scans, and X-rays.
  Radiologists can receive timely medical interventions and accurate diagnoses by using
  systems that can identify anomalies such as tumors, fractures, and other conditions [10]
• Object detection automates quality control and defect detection, simplifying manufac-
  turing processes. Systems are able to check products for flaws, locate missing parts,
  and guarantee that quality standards are being met. Errors are decreased, productivity is
  increased, and product quality is improved by this automation [11]

    Object detection is also used in many applications. Human detection [12] is used to iden-
tify the individual faces of humans. Traffic Management and Safety [13] enables traffic cameras
can detect vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists, enabling real-time traffic monitoring, congestion

                                                                                     13
                                                                      Multimedia Tools and Applications

detection, and accident prevention. Agricultural Monitoring and Precision Farming [14] enables
systems can identify and track crops, assess plant health, and detect pests or diseases. Empow-
ered with this information, farmers can refine their irrigation, fertilization, and pest control prac-
tices, leading to enhanced crop yields while minimizing environmental impact. Environmental
Monitoring and Protection [15] enables systems can detect and track wildlife, monitor deforesta-
tion, and identify pollution sources. This information enables environmental agencies to make
informed conservation, resource management, and pollution control decisions.

2 2Object detection performance metrics and Non‑Maximal
   Suppression (NMS)

2.1 Object detection performance metrics

In the object detection model, there are two most common standard performance evaluation
metrics [16] used to examine and measure the overall performance of different applications
that mainly work on the detection of objects

• Average Precision (AP)
• Intersection over Union (IoU)

3 Average Precision (AP)

   Average precision is an area that is calculated for the individual defined category under
   the recall and precision curve. Precision measures a percentage of the ratio in between
   the prediction of true positives and all the positives in the model. Recall also measures
   a percentage of the ratio of positive classes that the model correctly predicts. The high
   recall can result in a high false positive rate with a low precision value. To overcome
   this, need to maintain a trade-off between recall and precision. AP include this trade-off
   in the form of the precision and recall curve, which mentions that the curve of precision
   against recall by assigning different threshold value.
   Mean Average Precision (mAP) serves as a commonly employed metric aimed at
   assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of object detection models developed using
   deep learning techniques. Its calculation involves averages of the individual average pre-
   cision (AP) scores of each object class present in the dataset. AP, in turn, measures the
   precision and recall of the model’s detections for a particular class.
                                                1 ∑N
                                       mAP =           APi                                         (1)
                                                N  i=0

4 Intersection over Union (IoU)

   IOU is a famous measurement technique used to find the accurate localization of
   objects and also identify the localization errors in object detection models by using
   bounding boxes. It measures the overlap between predicted bounding boxes gener-

13
Multimedia Tools and Applications

   ated by an object detection algorithm and the true bounding boxes of objects present
   in the dataset. IoU is calculated as the ratio between the area of overlap between the
   predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box and the combined area of
   both boxes. A higher IoU value indicates the more accurate predictions Fig. 2.
   Several fundamental performance metrics utilized by AP are:

• Precision: Precision measures the proportion of positive identifications that are actu-
  ally correct. Precision is calculated by dividing the number of true positives (TP) by the
  total number of positive predictions (TP+FP), where FP means false positive.
                                                  TP
                                Precision =                                                 (2)
                                                TP + FP
• Recall: Recall also known as true positive rate (TPR) or sensitivity, is a metric that
  expresses how many actual positive instances a machine learning model correctly iden-
  tifies as positive; in other words, it shows how well the model can identify all relevant
  positive cases. Recall is computed as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the total number
  of actual positive instances (TP + FN), where FN is the number of false negatives.
                                                 TP
                                    Recall =                                                (3)
                                               TP + FN

                                                                Multimedia Tools and Applications

• F1 score: F1 score also called balanced F-score or F-measure, is most commonly used
  evaluation metric to estimate the performance of a classification model, especially
  when dealing with imbalanced datasets. It combines two important metrics: precision
  and recall, giving you a more comprehensive picture of your model’s accuracy.
                                     2 × Precision × Recall
                        F1 score =                                                           (4)
                                       Precision + Recall

    Precision and recall are commonly used as performance estimation metrics to gauge the
efficiency of diverse detection algorithms, as shown in Fig. 3. Some studies have combined
these metrics to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Among the various combina-
tions, recall and precision are the most prevalent.
    In YOLO versions, mean Average Precision (mAP) is definitely the most widely used
and primary metric in object detection for evaluating the performance across different
datasets. YOLO prioritizes both accuracy and speed, and mAP reflects this by considering
both aspects. mAP captures both the precision (correctness of detections) and recall (com-
pleteness of detections) of a model, giving a balanced picture of its performance. But in
YOLO versions, F1 score is not considered as a primary metric, because in object detec-
tion tasks where certain classes are significantly more frequent than others, F1-score can
be significantly skewed towards the majority class, making it unreliable for assessing per-
formance on minority classes [16]. A detection is considered as correct only if both the
class and bounding box are accurate. A missed detection (false negative) or a wrongly
attributed detection (false positive) penalizes the F1-score equally, even though they rep-
resent different types of errors. This leads to YOLO often requiring separate analysis of
these errors for targeted improvement. Object detection often involves detecting multiple
objects in an image. F1-score doesn’t directly capture the ability to detect multiple objects
accurately, whereas mAP with specific criteria for multiple object detection offers a more
nuanced evaluation. While the IoU is not a standalone metric, IoU is crucial for calculating

by different applications

13

mAP [17]. A higher IoU threshold increases the precision (reducing false positives) but
can also decrease recall (missing more true positives). Conversely, a lower IoU threshold
improves recall but sacrifices precision. This trade-off is reflected in the mAP calculation.
IoU thresholds can be adjusted for individual object classes, allowing for nuanced evalua-
tion of YOLO’s performance on different categories, particularly crucial for datasets with
varying object sizes and complexities.
    mAP and IoU also have shortcomings: First, it only considers the overlap between
ground truth and predicted bounding boxes, not their size or exact location. This can be
misleading if a model detects objects accurately but with the wrong size or slightly off-
center. Second, mAP can be affected by the characteristics of the specific dataset used for
evaluation. Models trained on easier datasets might have higher mAP compared to those
trained on harder datasets, even if their real-world performance is similar.
    By considering the following alternatives for mAP and IoU leads to higher performance
in object detection: i) Employing a range of thresholds, including AP50 and AP75, pro-
vides a nuanced assessment of model performance across diverse object sizes and overlaps.
ii) Integration of IoU with metrics such as localization error, false positive rate, and Frames
Per Second (FPS) yields a comprehensive evaluation, offering insights into multiple facets
of model capabilities, iii) Tailoring metrics to specific applications, such as tracking accu-
racy for video object tracking or recall at high confidence thresholds for anomaly detection,
enhances relevance and accuracy and iv) CorLoc measures the percentage of correct object
localizations, evaluating the accuracy of object bounding box predictions [18]. Depending
on the application, specialized metrics are utilized. For example, in autonomous driving,
metrics like Average Precision at Different Distances (APD) might be relevant.

4.1 Non‑Maximal Suppression (NMS)

In object detection tasks, there is a possibility of an appearance of several bounding
boxes for a single object in a class with diverse confidence values. NMS [20] is an effi-
cient method used in most defect detection systems to overcome the multiple bounding box
problem. It is a post processing method to improve overall defect detection quality by keep-
ing the appropriate bounding box Fig. 4.

5 Datasets

Dataset constitutes a vast collection of interconnected data points employed for the pur-
pose of training and evaluating the models within the domains of machine learning and
deep learning. They supply the information needed for models to learn and predictions.
Selecting the appropriate dataset enhances the model’s performance and yields superior
outcomes in the proposed techniques [21–23].
   In order to address data scarcity, improve model performance, reduce biases, adjust
to changing requirements, and customize models for particular domains, new dataset
creation is essential. New datasets are necessary to advance machine learning process
in a variety of applications, which includes medical diagnostics, computer vision and
cybersecurity. The process of dataset creation includes two stages:

• Data Collection: Data collection is a crucial step in developing effective computer
  vision systems. In order to teach algorithms to recognize and comprehend visual

                                                                                   13
                                                                  Multimedia Tools and Applications

Fig. 4  Non-Maximal Suppression

    information, it entails obtaining and processing photos and videos. [24] The effec-
    tiveness and generalizability of the resulting computer vision models are strongly
    influenced by the quality and diversity of the data that was gathered. When creating
    the dataset, a few variables are carefully taken into account for the inclusion and
    exclusion of samples, including lighting, orientation, pose, and the type of environ-
    ment (rainy, sunny, daytime, or nighttime) [25, 26]. As a result, training does not
    directly benefit from collecting data from various sensors or cameras. Pre-process-
    ing huge data is a vital step in data analysis and modeling aimed at improving and
    standardizing the data for optimal results.
•   Data annotation: In computer vision, data annotation is essential to allowing
    machines to comprehend and process visual data. In order to give machine learn-
    ing models with ground truth information, it entails labelling and tagging raw data,
    such as pictures and videos [27]. Algorithms that are trained for tasks like image
    classification, object detection and image segmentation require this process. Anno-
    tating data can be done automatically or manually. Although manual annotation is
    more precise, it can be difficult and time-consuming. Although automatic annotation
    [28] is less expensive and faster than manual annotation, it is less accurate. Dur-
    ing the annotation process, the identified objects are surrounded by a bounding box
    that stores their properties. Bounding boxes are essential components of deep learn-
    ing-based computer vision applications. They supply the input data required for the
    model to acquire object recognition and localization skills. [24] The model predicts
    the bounding boxes for class objects in new images or videos during inference. In
    recent years, many tools for annotation have been developed; some are free, while
    others require a premium license. They are,
•   LabelImg is a graphical tool for image annotation used in object detection and
    instance segmentation. This tool is very simple to use by offering an intuitive inter-
    face for annotating images with bounding boxes, polygons, and other markings.
    Export the annotation files in any format supported by YOLO [29].
•   MakeSense AI is an open-source web application that facilitates the annotation of
    images and videos. This tool supports diverse label types and provides annotation files
    in various formats, including YOLO, VGG JSON, CSV and VOC XML [30].
•   Roboflow is a web-based annotation tool that enables users to annotate pictures and
    videos for computer vision applications. It is a flexible and effective solution for anno-
    tating data for a wide range of applications thanks to its user-friendly interface, assort-

    ment of annotation tools, Label Assist feature, collaborative capabilities, integration
    with Roboflow Universe, strong data management, and quality control tools. This file is
    supported in YOLO [31].
•   LabelBox can easily annotate digital images with lines, polygons, rectangles, and other
    shapes. The paid LabelBox annotation tool offers a better platform for data science,
    labelling, and data management [32].
•   LabelMe is an open-source and web-based annotation tool for labeling images and
    frames in videos. It allows users to draw bounding boxes, polygons and keypoints in
    an image for the identification of an object. After annotation, the files are exported to
    XML format [33].
•   CVAT is used in CV tasks and it is an annotation tool for images and interactive video.
    It is free and open source written in javascript and Python. It supports only supervised
    learning methods [34].
•   VOTT (Visual Object Tagging Tool) is also used labeling the images and frames. This
    tool is developed by Microsoft and it is open source. VOTT is a React + Redux Web
    application written in TypeScript [35].

5.1 Existing Datasets

Over the last decade, an excessive number of datasets and benchmarks have emerged,
encompassing challenges like PASCAL VOC and ILSVRC. This section focuses on the
most frequently utilized datasets in the CV domain.

5.1.1 Cifar10

The CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, 10 classes) dataset [36]
consists of 60000 32x32 color images, which is a subdivision of the dataset- Tiny
Images. Ten mutually exclusive classes are assigned to the images: bird, automobile,
airplane, cat, frog, dog, horse, deer, truck (includes only heavy trucks) and ship. Each
class has 6000 images total, of which 5000 are for training and 1000 are for testing. It
is an open database and is used by many researchers [37] to develop an accurate detec-
tion model. Images for the dataset are gathered by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and
Geoffrey Hinton.

5.1.2 Imagenet

When ImageNet [38] was first created, the intention was to add 500–1000 images
per concept to the WordNet hierarchy. Search engine queries were used to obtain
images for each concept, and Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to validate inter-
est images. This dataset was created by a group of researchers and professors at
Princeton, Stanford, and UNC-Chapel Hill. ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual
Recognition Challenge) is the furthermost universally used subcategory of the Ima-
geNet dataset. This subcategory includes 1000 classes, 1,281,167 images for the
training process, 50,000 images for the validation process and 100,000 images for
the testing process [26].

                                                                                  13
                                                                Multimedia Tools and Applications

5.1.3 MS COCO

MS COCO (Microsoft common objects in context) [39] [40], which is a wide-ranging
image dataset used for computer vision projects and published by Microsoft. This dataset
is used for real-time object detection and image segmentation process. The COCO dataset
consists of 80 different class objects pretrained using the annotation process. The annotated
file of the COCO dataset is stored in the format JSON file.

5.1.4 OID

OID (Open images dataset) [41] is an open-source dataset created by Google. Collections
of over 9 million images with rich annotations (an average of 8.4 objects per image) are
freely available in this dataset. It offers databases and samples for computer vision and
machine learning tasks. According to the conditions of the CC-by 4.0 license, the OID is
made available for commercial use. This dataset’s photos are all of excellent quality and
include multiple objects.
   Other datasets that are used in previous research work include Remote sensing target
detection [42] [43] [44], text detection [45] [46] [47], and Pedestrian detection [48] [49]
[50].
   For achieving an accurate and robust object detection model, carefully consider the fol-
lowing factors such as dataset size, bias in input data, domain gap and image quality for
developing the models that perform well not just in the training data but also in the real
world.

• Dataset size- Small or homogenous datasets can lead to overfitting and poor perfor-
  mance on unseen data. Larger and more diverse datasets expose the model to a wider
  range of scenarios and appearances, leading to better generalization and robustness [21,
  22].
• Bias in input data- i) Selection Bias- The selection of data from limited examples leads
  to a model biased towards specific scenarios. This can lead to unfair and inaccurate
  results when applied to different scenarios. ii) Label Bias- The model may be affected
  by bias when objects are labeled incorrectly. This issue can arise from human mistakes,
  unclear definitions, or subjective interpretations during the labeling process. In the case
  of inaccurate annotations of object boundaries, the model may encounter difficulties in
  exactly identifying the location of objects in images, thereby impacting both localiza-
  tion and classification performance [51].
• Domain gap- When a notable distinction exists in the distribution of testing and train-
  ing data (referred to as a domain gap), the model might face challenges in generaliza-
  tion. To overcome this issue, it may be essential to employ domain adaptation tech-
  niques in such instances [51].
• Image quality- Blurry and low-resolution images affect the model learning capability
  and reduce its effectiveness.

   These factors need to be carefully handled, and this will increase the robustness of the
object detection model using the following strategies:

• Augmentation technique- The collection of some rare data is very difficult (e.g. Col-
  lection of defect images in machinery parts). However, the dataset size affects the per-

13
Multimedia Tools and Applications

    formance of the model. So, for increasing the dataset size, several augmentation tech-
    niques are used like rotation, translation, scaling and under varying lighting effects.
    GAN is one of the techniques mainly used to increase the dataset size. This will
    increase the model generalization.
•   Selection bias that occurred in the dataset is reduced using the combination of semi-
    supervised learning with distant supervision and the random sampling method. Label
    bias is reduced by using diverse annotators, fairness metrics and majority voting [51].
•   The train, validate, and test dataset must be carefully split. While splitting, each set
    should represent the overall distribution of the data to avoid skewed results. Stratified
    sampling techniques can help to achieve this split. In general, 80% of data in the train-
    ing set, 10% of data in the validation set and 10% of data in the test set. Correct dataset
    split will reduce the overfitting and underfitting issues.
•   In image acquisition, ensure a high-quality image, take the image in different scenarios,
    angles, and lighting, which will enhance object detection in computer vision and also
    definitely increase the size of the dataset. This will ensure robustness in the developed
    model.
•   Fine-tuning the hyperparameters will control the performance and behaviour in the
    developed model. The hyperparameters include learning rate, batch size, optimizer and
    number of epochs.

6 Object detection technique

Object detection serves as a key component of computer vision tasks, primarily focused
on accurately identifying and localizing various objects within an image. Object detection
techniques are categorized into two groups such as conventional object detectors and object
detectors based on deep learning (DL), as shown in Fig. 5. DL object detectors are further
divided into two sub categories: one stage detectors and two stage detectors.

6.1 Conventional object detectors

The majority of the conventional object detection algorithms are developed based on hand-
crafter features, because there is no quality image representation before 20 years back.
Conventional detectors used the following approaches: VJ detectors, HOG and DPM [52].

6.1.1 Viola Jones (VJ) Detector

This was the initial detector for detecting human faces before 21 years ago. It was devel-
oped by Paul Viola and Micheal Jones in 2001. It looks for windows with human faces [53]
in them by utilizing sliding windows to scan an image at every scale and position. Essen-
tially, the sliding windows look for characteristics resembling "haar." Consequently, the
feature points of an image are derived from the Haar wavelet. It employs integral images,
which make each sliding window’s computational complexity independent of its size, to
expedite detection. The Adaboost algorithm, which selects a compact set of highly inform-
ative features from an extensive pool of randomly generated features, is specifically tai-
lored for the face detection process. It is another method the authors used to increase detec-
tion speed. In order to lower its computational overhead, the algorithm also used Detection

Cascades [54], a multi-stage detection paradigm, which focuses more computations on face
targets and less on background windows.

6.1.2 Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) Detector

HOG (2005) is developed by N. Dalal and B. Triggs, and this is an improvement of SIFT
(Shift invariant feature transform). Like sliding window, HOG used blocks to identify the
gradients from magnitude. HOG is mostly used in pedestrian detection. The HOG detec-
tor performs the scaling process to input images several times while maintaining the same
size of a detection window to identify objects of various sizes. Three color channels are
assessed if the input image is colored. Consequently, gradients for each of the three-color
channels in an image are computed, and the highest gradient from the corresponding angle
and three-channel is chosen for further action. To obtain the desired outcome, a gradi-
ent histogram vector is made and normalized to the vectors. Subsequently, data is sent to
machine learning algorithms, like Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are used for
training the classifiers. The maximum redundant bounding box of the class object is elimi-
nated using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS).

6.1.3 Deformable Part‑based Model (DPM)

P. Felzenszwalb first suggested the DPM detector framework in 2008 as an extension of
the HOG detector framework. R. Girshick later made various enhancements to DPM. DPM
employs a ’divide and conquer’ strategy to detect an object, such as a ’car,’ by identifying
its window, body, and wheels. The training process teaches the model how to effectively

13
Multimedia Tools and Applications

decompose an object, while the inference process combines detections from different
object parts. DPM consists of two components: root filter and part filters. Root filters is
a detection window that roughly encloses the object of interest. Part filters are employed
to detect and localize individual objects within an image. R. Girshick employed a special-
ized form of Multi-instance learning to enhance detection accuracy. He also incorporated
several other critical techniques, including ’bounding box regression,’ ’hard negative min-
ing,’ and ’context priming.’ Subsequently, he implemented a cascade architecture, which
resulted in over a tenfold increase in speed without compromising accuracy.

6.2 Object detectors based on deep learning

Driven by exponential technological growth, object detection methods have emerged as
a key research domain in the area of computer vision. Previously, object detection was
done using conventional detection algorithms. Still, the pitfalls raised in it is handling a
huge number of generated proposals is difficult which leads to result in high false posi-
tive rate. Then, the feature extraction in this approach is very low. When the CNN model
emerged, the feature extraction in the image is achieved at a deep level by using deep learn-
ing techniques with less bias and achieving a big change in the object detection area. In
the training process, the effective model is achieved only when a huge number of labelled
datasets is included is the CNN model and the processing time is also increased. [55]
A diverse amount of architecture is added as the backbone for detecting objects such as
LeNet, AlexNet, R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and GoogLENet, etc.; based on deep learning
object detector methodology is categorized into two types: single stage detectors and two
stage detectors. Nowadays, for real-time object detection, single stage detectors process the
image at once and give better results. Two stage detectors process the input image twice for
feature extraction, which leads to lower inference speed than single stage detectors.

6.2.1 One stage detector

One stage detector has a very simpler architecture, and it is very fast in image feature
extraction. For example, YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet and LADet all these models follow the
one stage detector, which gives the better result.

• YOLO is a real time object detection model that differs from YOLOv1 to YOLOv8. In
  every iteration, whatever problems faced in previous versions are improved. In the next
  chapter, the YOLO versions are explained in detail.
• SSD (Single Shot multibox Detector) is a small and widely used object detection model
  developed by W. Liu, D. Anguelov, and D. Erhan et al. in 2015 [56]. For increasing
  a small object detection accuracy, it uses multi scale and multi reference methodol-
  ogy. SSD architecture includes two parts: SSD backbone- responsible for image fea-
  ture extraction, and SSD head- responsible for displaying the output using a bounding
  box. Using optimized SSD [57], research on vehicle and wheel detection is done, which
  gives better results in detection.
• RetinaNet [58] is developed by T. Y Lin, P. Goyal, R. Girshick, et al. for handling
  unbalanced datasets while training processes by changing the existing cross-entropy
  loss with a new loss function. It produces a very accurate result by achieving high accu-
  racy in detecting very small objects [59]. It includes four components: the bottom-up
  path- which includes ResNet architecture in the backbone for feature extraction; the

                                                                                  13
                                                               Multimedia Tools and Applications

  top-down path then FPN (Feature Pyramid Network)- which develops the finest multi-
  scale process for any image resolution size, classification subnet- that represents the
  probability distribution of each predicted class and at last anchor boxes and bounding
  box subnet- determines the offset value of each bounding box.
• LADet (Lightweight and Adaptive Network for Multi-scale Object Detection) [60],
  which is published in 2019 by J. Zhou et al. to address the issue of object detection
  scale variability.

6.2.2 Two stage detector

Two stages are utilized in two-stage detectors to identify the objects. Using detectors, the
first stage detects the region of objects. In the second stage, classification is done using
DL models based on detection Table 1. For instance, RCNN, SPP, Fast RCNN and Faster
RCNN [61].

• RCNN (Region-based Convolution Neural Network) [62] is developed by R. Girshick,
  J. Donahue, T.Darrell, et al. in 2015 for object detection using the CNN model. RCNN
  includes three steps in object detection: region extraction- selective search approach is
  used for extracting the regions if objects are placed in any orientation or scale; feature
  extraction using CNN- after region extraction, features can be extracted using CNN
  model and region classification- using SVM the classification is done, and NMS is used
  for eliminating the regions if IoU value beyond the assigned threshold value. Some of
  the limitations encountered because the features are extracted separately from each pro-
  posal, which leads to computational intensiveness, very time-consuming process and
  resource-demanding
• SPP (Spatial Pyramid Pooling networks) [63] was developed by K. He, X. Zhang, S.
  Ren et al. in 2015 to reduce the problem faced in RCNN by introducing a SPP-Net
  which is developed from SPM (Spatial Pyramid Matching). In SPP-net, the convolu-
  tional layer generates a single feature map with a consistent size for the entire input
  image. SPP employs a hierarchical or management pyramid structure to partition the
  input video or image into multiple levels, each representing a different spatial scale.
  Within each level of the CNN, pyramid cells extract the most significant feature values
  and feed them into the fully connected layers.
• Fast RCNN [64] is developed by R. Girshick in 2015 to improve the RCNN and SPP-
  Net for achieving high accuracy and speed. It consists of 2 stages: RPN (Region Pro-
  posal Network)- a CNN which takes the input image as input then it generates a cou-
  ple of potential bounding boxes for objects within the image. It is trained to assess
  the likelihood of a bounding box comprising an object and refine the bounding box’s
  coordinates and Fast RCNN Detector- it receives a candidate object bounding box and
  an input image. It then analyzes the image within the bounding box to determine the
  classes of an objects and then further refines the accuracy of the bounding box. With
  the help of a set of labeled images, the Fast RCNN detector is trained so that it can rec-
  ognize and subsequently identify objects within unseen images.
• Faster RCNN [65] was developed in 2015 by S. Ren, K. He, J. Sun and R. Gir-
  shick et al., which generated the bounding boxes on each and every object in addi-
  tion to showing the confidence score of bounding boxes by using the sliding win-
  dow technique. Anchor box is the term used to describe this recently constructed
  bounding box with the proper aspect ratio. After acquiring a fixed-size proposal,

   each is supplied to the convolutional layers. Then, the ReLU activation function
   is used to achieve the output in non-linearity. This enhancement in new architec-
   ture leads to achieving the best object detection algorithm. In Mask RCNN [66],
   the problem of instance segmentation is solved. Building upon the foundations of
   Faster R-CNN, Mask CNN expands its functionality by incorporating a mask predic-
   tion branch, which generates pixel-level masks for objects identified within prede-
   fined ROI (Region of Interest) based segment predictions. It has two stages: firstly, it
   gathers the input image, then creates a proposal wherever the object is placed in an
   image, and secondly, it predicts the object class, redefines the mask, and a bounding
   box is created for that object.

6.2.3 Challenges in object detection

• Data source- Object detection relies inherently on video, real-time scene inputs and
  images, , necessitating a high-quality source for optimal performance. This section
  delves into pertinent issues associated with the data source to underscore their sig-
  nificance in the object detection process.
• Issue in camera and object pose estimation- Target objects positioned farther or
  closer than the optimal range for capture may be insufficiently detailed for accurate
  detection, appearing either minuscule or blurry.
• Illumination- During image capture, various elements can influence the captured
  object’s representation, including the environment, physical location, and lighting
  conditions (indoor/outdoor, time of day, weather, background, viewing distance,
  etc.). Images acquired in uncontrolled outdoor settings pose particular challenges
  due to environmental variability. Similarly, indoor environments can introduce shad-
  ows or false positives due to sudden lighting changes [69].
• Need for massive datasets and computational power- Deep learning-based object
  detection algorithms require extensive datasets for computation, robust computational
  resources for processing the data and labor-intensive methods for annotations. The
  escalating volume of data generated from diverse sources has transformed the annota-
  tion of each object in visual content into a cumbersome and laborious undertaking.
• Occlusion- The image encompasses numerous distinct objects, each exhibiting
  differences from the others. Consequently, certain objects are partially or entirely
  obscured by other objects in the captured images, a phenomenon referred to as
  occlusion. To illustrate, extracting features becomes challenging when attempting to
  discern the phone object concealed behind the laptop object [69].
• Training on multi-scale data- Most object detectors are usually trained for a particu-
  lar input resolution. As a result, when these detectors are given inputs with different
  scales or resolutions, they frequently perform less than optimally.
• Real time detection speed- The primary challenge associated with real-time detection
  lies in achieving optimal speed, as the performance of object detection models is intri-
  cately linked to the swift and efficient classification and localization of objects. The
  demand for high-speed models in real-time environments, such as video processing,
  remains a critical obstacle in current research and development efforts [70].

7 Introduction to YOLO versions (YOLOv1 to YOLOv8)

7.1 YOLOv1

YOLO version1 is developed in 2016 by Joseph Redmon et al., which was published at the
IEEE conference on CVPR [71]. YOLOv1 is the foremost to present the end-to-end (real-
time) neural network approach with improved speed and accuracy. It follows a single shot/
proposal-free object detection model, which means it finds the bounding box and then finds
the probability of class category at once. As compared YOLOv1 with Faster RCNN, it finds
the class probability at one iteration, while Faster CNN requires multiple iterations for the
single image.

7.1.1 YOLOv1 architecture

YOLOv1 implement the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model and examines it on the
PASCAL VOC detection dataset [71, 72].
    The features are extracted from an image in the initial convolutional layer, and at last, the
coordinates (bounding box) and class probability are predicted in the fully connected layer.
There are 24 convolutional layers processed and used the two fully connected layers. As
shown in Fig. 6, each convolutional layer is followed by its corresponding max pooling opera-
tion. YOLOv1 variant ‘Fast YOLO’ has 9 convolutional layers with few filters for each layer
and is inspired by the GoogleNet inception module, which uses 1x1 convolutions to reduce the
number of channels before 3x3 and 5x5 convolutions, which significantly reduces the compu-
tational cost and helps prevent overfitting.
    The coordinates are defined by five components: (w, h, x, y, and confidence score). w and h
represent the height and width of the entire image, then x and y represent the bounding box’s
center coordinates, and the confidence score represents the IoU. The confidence score is repre-
sented in the Eq. 5.

                         Confidence score = predicted(obj) ∗ IoU truth
                                                                 predicted                   (5)

Fig. 6  YOLOv1 Architecture

                                                                                     13
                                                                     Multimedia Tools and Applications

   Non Maximal Suppression (NMS) is employed in YOLOv1, to overcome the difficulty
of generating multiple bounding boxes for a single object during detection. [65] The pre-
dictions are done by
                                        s ∗ s ∗ (b ∗ 5 + c)                                       (6)
  The model is evaluated on the Pascal VOC dataset, with parameters b=2, s=8, and
c=20. By applying this value in Eq.2
                                 8 ∗ 8 ∗ (2 ∗ 5 + 20) = 8 ∗ 8 ∗ 30

   The s represents the input image size after completion of the convolution layer, b rep-
resents the number of bounding box (value 2 represents the two bounding boxes- ground
truth and predicted) and c represent the number of mentioned classes used in the Pascal
VOC dataset.

7.2 YOLOv2

YOLOv2 is an improvement of YOLOv1 by increasing the speed and accuracy, and it was
developed by Joseph Redmon et al., 2016 [73]. YOLOv2 was later renamed as YOLO9000,
reflecting its ability to detect over 9000 object categories. YOLOv2 makes use of a CNN
backbone called Darknet-19, which is a simpler and faster version of VGGNet. Darknet-19
uses mostly 3x3 convolution and pooling layers, with a few 1x1 convolution layers in
between to compress the feature representation. This makes Darknet-19 a more efficient
and effective CNN backbone for YOLOv2 Fig. 7.
    The YOLOv1 uses an input image with a size of 224 x 244 for the training phase. When
it comes to the detection phase, the input dimension is up sample in to 448 x 448 pixels,
this will reduce the percent of mAP value. So, the YOLOv2 authors use the input size 448
x 448 pixels at training phase on ImageNet [26] dataset. This will increase the Map value
by 4%.

7.2.1 Improvements in YOLOv2

• Anchor Boxes: Anchor boxes is the main improvements on YOLOv2. Anchor boxes
  consist of a set of predefined bounding boxes that act as templates for the algorithm

Fig. 7  Anchor Box representations

13
Multimedia Tools and Applications

  to detect the objects. YOLOv2 predicts offsets from the anchor boxes to find the final
  bounding boxes of objects in an image. This allows YOLOv2 to detect objects of
  diverse sizes and aspect ratios because it can adjust the anchor boxes to fit the objects.
• Batch Normalization: Batch Normalization is done on all convolution layers to enhance
  the overall model reliability and accuracy of the developed model than YOLOv1. It acts
  as a regularizer and was mainly introduced to avoid overfitting during multiscale train-
  ing, then aggregate and average the predictions.
• Cost Function: YOLOv2 cost includes three loss functions. Localization loss is used to
  find the coordinates of the bounding box, then confidence loss is used to represent the
  presence or absence of an object in an image and classification loss is used for accu-
  rately predicting each category.
• Multi-scale detection: YOLOv2 mainly involves sampling the input image into different
  scales and training the model into each scale. Then, the individual results are summed
  up to produce the final predictions

7.3 YOLOv3

YOLOv3 is a real-time object detection model that also follows a single-stage detection
and was developed by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi in 2018 [74]. It is a successor to
YOLOv2 and is considerably faster and more accurate than its predecessor.
   Progress in image throughout the network there is a loss of fine features when do the
down sampling process, therefore YOLOv2 is struggled to detect the smaller objects
because of gradient flow missing. So the skip connections [75] is proposed with ResNet
architecture. Skip connection prevent the occurrences of vanishing gradient problem in
deep learning network.

7.3.1 Enhancement of YOLOv3

• FPN (Feature Pyramid Network): It enables YOLOv3 to detect objects at different sizes
  and all are done by combining information from different layers of the CNN.
• Bounding box prediction: YOLOv3 also predicts a bounding box with four coordinates
  ­(tx, ­ty, ­tw, ­th) as YOLOv2, with one improvement that is logistic regression, which is
   used to predict of objectness score for individual bounding box.
• Anchor box clustering: The clustering algorithm uses to ensure the multi-scale detec-
  tion with high accuracy. It determines the aspect ratio and optimal sizes for each anchor
  boxes Fig. 8.

7.3.2 YOLOv3 architecture

YOLOv3 started to describe the object detectors into three sections: backbone, head and
neck. The basic architecture of YOLOv3 is shown in Fig. 9.
    The backbone must be any CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that has a different
number of convolution layers. It is mainly responsible for deriving the important features
from the image or video. It captures features at diverse scale in hierarchical manner from
basic features such as edges, textures, patterns into large potential features such as parts of
the objects and semantic data.
    The neck part is an intermediary that is placed between the backbone and the head.
It includes FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks) which perform refinement and aggregation

                                                                                   13

of features from the backbone, then focuses on semantic information enhancement
across the multiple scale images.
   The head is the last object detector component, which predicts the final output based
on the processed features are extracted from the backbone of the network and enhanced
by the neck section. It uses NMS to avoid the problem of arising multiple bounding box
predictions and give sufficient results with a high confidence value bounding box.
   YOLOv3 uses the Darknet-53 architecture in its backbone. It consists of 53 convolu-
tion layers. It omits all the pooling layers used in previous YOLO versions with residual
and stride convolution. Every convolutional layer within the network is followed by a
Leaky ReLU activation function and a Batch normalization operation. On top of the
53 layers in Darknet 53, an additional 53 layers are stacked in the detection head. So,
totally in YOLOv3, 106 convolution layers are presented.

7.4 YOLOv4

After two years of publication of YOLOv3 [74], no new versions of YOLO are published.
In April 2020, Alexey Bochkovskiy et al. proposed the YOLOv4 official paper. This is the
first time the author of YOLO has changed and kept the YOLO fundamentals by enhancing
the features for improvement in speed and accuracy.

7.4.1 Enhancement of YOLOv4

• Bag of Specials (BoS): This method lightly improves the inference cost with sufficient
  improve in accuracy.
• Bag of Freebies (BoF): This method mainly concentrates on the data augmentation
  process by changing the strategy of the training process by increasing the training cost.
  It does not increase the inference speed.
• Self-adversarial Training (SAT): Adversarial attacks involve manipulating the input
  image in a way that deceives the model into not detecting the presence of the object
  while maintaining its original label, enabling the model to correctly identify the object,
  thereby enhancing its resilience to perturbations.

7.4.2 YOLOv4 architecture

The CNN model used in the backbone of YOLOv4 [76] is CSPDarket-53. Many fea-
ture extraction models are experimented such as EfficientNet-B3, CSPDarknet-53 and
CSPResNext-50 in terms of reducing the problem of vanishing gradient and bolstering
features.
   At the neck part, the feature aggregation is performed. In [76] authors try to experiment
with many techniques such as Path Aggregation Network (PANet) and FPN. PANet is the
enhanced version of FPN. PANet works on the method of bottom-up data augmentation
path with FPN (i.e., top-down path), which creates a short link for creating a very fine-
grained features. The original PANet used the addition method while its extension (modi-
fied PANet) shown in the Fig. 10 [76], used the concatenation method which improves the
overall prediction accuracy. So, the authors recommend to use PANet in YOLOv4 object
detection model.
   In head, CIoU loss function [77] is used, and it is implemented as a BOF, focused on the
overlap of bounding boxes that are raised between the ground truth and predicted image.
CIoU loss function states that the aspect ratio factor is unimportant if no overlap occurs
and gives more attention if more overlap occurs [78]. The CIoU loss function is stated as

                                                        d2
                                    LCIoU = 1 − IoU +      + 𝛼v                          (7)
                                                        C2
  The YOLOv4 model is tested on the MS COCO dataset 2017; YOLOv4 attained an
AP50 of 65.7% and AP75 of 46.6% using 50 FPS in a NVIDIA V100.

7.5 YOLOv5

After two months of YOLOv4 was published, YOLOv5 [79] was released in 2020 by Glen
Jocher, Ultralytics founder. Darknet architecture is not used in YOLOv5 instead, they used
Pytorch. Autoanchor is an algorithm that YOLOv5 used as a tool to check and maintain the

                                                                                 13

anchor boxes. The initial conditions of (GE) Genetic Evolution algorithm is developed by
applying a K-means clustering to label a dataset. GE uses the CIoU loss function [77] to
evolve the anchor boxes by default to 1000 generations.

7.5.1 YOLOv5 architecture

YOLOv5 architecture includes SPPF (Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast) followed by a con-
volution layer is processes the input feature at different scales. This layer increases the
computation process of the whole network because the features are processed in multiple
scales. The upsampling is responsible for increasing the feature resolution.
   In the backbone, the CSPDarknet 53 is used in addition to that, the strided convolu-
tion layer is performed with a higher window size to reduce the computational cost. The
modified CSP-PAN and SPPF are deployed in the neck and head includes YOLOv3. For
enlarging the size of the dataset, YOLOv5 uses different augmentation techniques such as
mosaic, copy-paste [74], affine, flipping, HSV augmentation, and mixup [81]. Every con-
volution layer includes both the SiLU activation function and Batch Normalization.
   YOLOv5 include five diverse versions: YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l
and YOLOv5x shown in the Table 2. These versions differ by depth and width of the con-
volutional layers.
   YOLOv5 is maintained by Ultralytics, freely available used by many users and it is
the best choice for real time object detection. The main benefit is very fast compared to

previous versions because it uses PyTorch. YOLOv5 common applications include defect
detection, vehicle detection, and pedestrian detection.

7.6 YOLOv6

YOLOv6 [82] was published by Meituan Incorporates in September 2022. The main pur-
pose of this version development is to satisfy the requirements of industrial applications,
such as the need to work on any hardware options to maintain a high-level speed and accu-
racy. YOLOv6 network consists of CSPStackRep blocks or RepVGG for backbone, PAN
for neck and efficient decoupled head for head. At last, YOLOv6 outperforms very well
with its increased speed and accuracy than the previous versions.
   Like YOLOv5, YOLOv6 also include different versions starts from YOLOv6N has
fewer model parameters with high speed and end with YOLOv6L with maximal accuracy.
YOLOv6 uses anchor free technique which achieves 51% faster than the anchor-based tech-
nique. It introduced a reparametrized technique for both neck and backbone as Rep-PAN
and EfficientRep respectively. YOLOv6 introduced the decoupled head for head part as
shown in Fig. 11.
   YOLOv6 provides two loss functions: Varifocal loss (VFL) [83] and distribution focal
loss (DFL) [84]. VFL is used as a classification loss, and DFL include SIoU and GIoU
and deployed for regression loss. VFL is derived from focal loss by maintaining the
negative and positive data at different degrees of importance for label assignment using
a learning approach called task alignment introduced in TOOD [85]. Using channel-wise

fast detection.
   YOLOv6 also has eight scaled variations from YOLOv6N to YOLOv6L6. All these ver-
sions are evaluated on the MS COCO dataset 2017, which got a mAP 57.2% for 24FPS.

7.7 YOLOv7

After a month of release of YOLOv6, the YOLO v7 [88] was released by the same author
of YOLOv4. Several versions are released in YOLO, mainly focusing on increasing the
GPU speed with high inferencing speed. Compared to the previous, YOLOv7 achieves
high speed and accuracy object detectors between the 5FPS and 160FPS. It proposed vari-
ous architectural changes to increase the detection speed and overall accuracy. Figure 12
and 13. Shows the complete architectural design of YOLOv7. It split into two main catego-
ries: Architectural design and Bag-of-Freebies.

13
Multimedia Tools and Applications

7.7.1 YOLOv7 architecture

The architectural design is divided into two reforms:

   1. E-ELAN (Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Network)
   E-ELAN is an extended version of ELAN [81]. ELAN emphasizes the develop-
   ment of efficient network models through a focus on controlling the gradient
   flow within the network. This controlled flow, by ensuring proper information
   propagation and feedback, enables deep network models to converge and learn
   more effectively and efficiently. E-ELAN uses shuffle, expand, and merge car-
   dinality like ELAN. In E-ELAN, the only changes made in the computation
   block of these cardinalities. It does not make changes to the channel multiplier.
   It enhances the model learning capability without changing the original path of
   gradient.
   2. Model scaling for concatenation based models
   Scaling refers to creating models in various sizes by adjusting certain model attrib-
   utes. The conventional depth scaling technique reduces the hardware requirements
   of a model by modifying the ratio between the number of input and output channels
   within the transition layer. To preserve the model’s structure, YOLOv7 suggested a
   new scaling strategy for the concatenation base model in which each block’s depth
   and width are scaled by the same amount.

7.7.2 Bag of freebies

   1. Planned re-parameterized convolution
   YOLOv7 model is inspired by re-parameterized convolution [89]. In this concept,
   introducing the RepConv identity connection can negatively impact the performance
   of DenseNet and ResNet architectures, which utilize residual and concatenation con-
   nections as key elements. To avoid the problem of identity connection, YOLOv7 uses
   a RepConv and the identity connection is removed.
   2. Course label for auxiliary head and fine label for lead head
   YOLOv7 utilizes a dual-head architecture. The lead head serves as the final predic-
   tion stage, then the auxiliary head assists in the training process by providing extra
   guidance.

   Variations of YOLOv7 include: YOLOv7tiny, YOLOv7x, YOLOv7E6, YOLOv7D6.

7.7.3 YOLOv8

The YOLO family of object detection models recently welcomed its newest mem-
ber, YOLOv8, published by Ultralytics in January 2023 [90]. This company is
also responsible for developing the highly successful YOLOv5 model. YOLOv8
has gained much popularity due to its versatility in tackling various vision
tasks, including segmentation, tracking, object detection, classification, and pose
estimation.

                                                                              13

7.7.4 YOLOv8 architecture

With a few minor CSP layer modifications, YOLOv8 has a backbone that is most similar
to YOLOv5, in YOLOv8 it’s called a C2f module. C2f includes two convolution opera-
tions with cross stage partial bottleneck. Figures 14 and 15 shows the overall architec-
ture design of YOLOv8.
   YOLO version 8 utilizes an anchor-free detection model with a decoupled head architec-
ture, allowing for independent processing of classification, regression, and object detection
tasks. In YOLOv8 output, the sigmoid activation function is used for calculating the object
score and for representing class probabilities, the softmax activation function is utilized.
   For determining the loss value of bounding box, YOLOv8 uses the CIoU loss func-
tion [77] and for calculating the binary cross entropy for classification loss, it uses the
DFL loss function [84]. As an alternative to the conventional neck architecture, it used the

13
Multimedia Tools and Applications

CSPdarknet53 with C2f module. The C2f is responsible for finding the semantic segmenta-
tion of an input.

7.7.5 Features of YOLOv8

• Multiple backbones: It supports multiple backbones such as CSPDarknet, ResNet and
  EfficientNet enabling user flexibility to find the best model.
• Data Augmentation: To broaden the model, it incorporates the most sophisticated data
  augmentation methods, like CutMix and MixUp [81].
• Versatile training: It uses flexible training to optimize learning rate and enable adjust-
  ment for loss function during training which leads to better performance.

7.7.6 Experimental analysis

The experimental analysis has been conducted on YOLOv8, as the findings of the study
indicate that YOLOv8 consistently exhibits superior performance in terms of achieving
high inference speed and accurate detection of objects. Consequently, the implementation
has been executed on the specified dataset within the Google Colab environment.

Dataset The dataset is created for tablet blister packages to identify the tablet defects
within the blister. Five defect classes are included in the dataset, such as broken tablets,
missing tablets, empty tablets, foreign particles and color mismatch. The dataset consists of
4397 images for training, validating and testing the model.

Results The YOLOv8s model was trained on a dataset of 3529 images for 50
epochs, employing the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer for enhancing the
prediction accuracy. The normalized confusion matrix for all these classes is shown in the
Fig. 16.

  The results show the graph for precision, recall and mAP@.50 score for all classes. The
mAP@.50 value for all classes was 0.97, as shown in the Fig. 17

8 Comparison of YOLO with other object detectors

Due to its notable speed and efficiency, YOLO has significantly transformed the landscape
of object detection, emerging as a formidable competitor to well-established techniques
such as Viola-Jones, HOG, DPM and RCNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, SPP and SSD.
The efficacy of YOLO in overcoming certain limitations inherent in these conventional
methods is exemplified by the following considerations:
   Traditional methods often involve handcrafted features and separate steps for object
detection, which might limit their ability to learn intricate patterns and variations in objects
[91]. Viola-Jones and HOG use specific features like "edges" or "gradients" to find objects
[53]. This can be tricky if the object looks different or is in a strange position. On the other
hand, YOLO looks at the whole image and learns what an object looks like in all sorts of
ways. This makes it better at dealing with real-world situations where things might not be
perfect. Viola-Jones and HOG usually use sliding windows or a sequence of classifiers at
various scales, resulting in several passes over the image [54] and R-CNN is a two-stage,

                                                                                    13
                                                               Multimedia Tools and Applications

involving region proposal and subsequent classification, making the model slower. The
R-CNN is unsuitable for real-time applications because it takes around 47 seconds to test
one image. This can be expensive in terms of computation, especially in the training phase,
because of the classifications of 2000 regions [92]. In contrast, YOLO processes the entire
image in one pass to achieve real-time inference, which is ideal for applications like self-
driving cars and video surveillance.
   Faster R-CNN is a two-stage approach with a RPN generating proposals followed by
classification and refinement [64]. This can be computationally more intensive than

13
Multimedia Tools and Applications

YOLO’s single-pass design. Despite its success, Faster R-CNN’s multi-stage processing
may not be as effective for real-time requirements, particularly in scenarios where rapid
decision-making is crucial. The performance of the models over time is depend upon the
efficacy of the preceding system. The SPP and Fast R-CNN both follow the selective search
mechanism, which leads to time-consuming. The grid-based approach eliminates the need
for an explicit region proposal step, making YOLO computationally more efficient. SSD
also predicts multiple bounding boxes like YOLO, but it uses a set of predefined default
boxes (or anchors) at different scales and aspect ratios, while YOLO follows the grid tech-
nique that divides the images into grid cells for predicting multiple bounding boxes with its
corresponding class probabilities. Video object detection is challenging task in real world,
it is overcome by several techniques like temporal feature blender, spatio temporal col-
laboration [105] [107] and video captioning of real time data is achieved using global local
representation [106]. Thus the YOLO also effectively detect the objects in video streaming
data and well suited for real time applications.

9 Applications of diverse YOLO versions

YOLO is a real time object detection model that used in many fields now a day by enabling
fast identification and accurate tracking of various objects in an image or video such as
vehicle detection, defect detection. YOLO models also used in agriculture, medical field,
security system, industrial areas and traffic applications. Table 3 summarize the YOLO
used in different applications.

10 Discussion

Object detection consists of fundamental tasks such as object classification, localization,
detection and segmentation. The most popularly used object detection model nowadays is
YOLO [95], which works on real-time object detection environments by different applica-
tions. It mainly works on single stage object detectors for achieving high detection accu-
racy and inference time in single shot. All YOLO versions refine and enhance the limita-
tions of a tradeoff between the speed and accuracy in previous versions. For instance, in
YOLOv2, an anchor box is introduced, improving object localization and achieving high
accuracy. In YOLOv3, the feature extraction is done at multiple scales to improve the
detection performance and aim in detect the smaller objects. In YOLOv4, enhancement
includes new augmentation techniques, feature aggregation and a bag of freebies concept.
This enhancement ensures a high gain in accuracy and inference speed.
    After a couple of months, YOLOv5 is released without presenting the official paper, and
it is based on PyTorch, an implementation available in the GitHub repository. YOLOv6
includes the anchor box and decoupled head concept which leads to improvement in over-
all model performance. YOLOv7 mainly focused on architectural reforms, which include
E-ELAN architecture by reducing the problem of occlusion and tiny object detection. The
latest version YOLOv8, aims to solve the problem faced in previous versions by introduc-
ing the C2f module which is responsible for finding the semantic segmentation using two
convolution layers. YOLOv8 solves the occlusion issue, and small object detection, intro-
duces a new augmentation technique for improving the overall detection accuracy.

   Although YOLO models are well-known for their speed and efficiency, there exist certain
computational efficiency challenges, particularly in real-time applications. These challenges
are essential factors to address in order to guarantee optimal performance in situations where
swift object detection is of utmost importance.

• Trade-off between speed and accuracy- The priority placed on speed by YOLO can
  occasionally lead to a compromise in detection accuracy. In specific situations, attaining
  increased accuracy may demand a reduction in computational efficiency, prompting a need
  to carefully balance these aspects in respect to the specific requirements of the application.
• Dynamic environment adaptation- Real-world situations are inherently dynamic, neces-
  sitating rapid adaptability of object detection systems to environmental fluctuations,
  alterations in lighting conditions, and the presence of moving objects. This adaptability
  is crucial to maintain precision and reliability in real-time.
• Multi scale object detection- Detecting objects across multiple scales is imperative in
  real-world scenarios, where scenes encompass objects of varied sizes. The simultane-
  ous detection of objects with diverse scales is essential for a thorough understanding of
  the scene.

10.1 Main enhancements in YOLO versions

• Anchor box: YOLOv2 incorporates the anchor box, which leads to increase the predic-
  tion accuracy of the bounding box. YOLOv1 doesn’t include the anchor box technique.
• Architecture: The initial versions follow the Darknet architecture and after YOLOv3,
  the ultralytics incorporates Pytorch framework and remaining versions are followed the
  Pytorch framework.
• Backbone: At first, the backbone of YOLO starts with Darknet architecture. This archi-
  tecture changed over time to achieve high accuracy and speed. Then, in YOLOv4, cross
  stage partial connections are introduced; in YOLOv6 and YOLOv7, the reparameteriza-
  tion technique and model scaling are incorporated.

10.2 Open challenges and emerging research directions of YOLO versions

10.2.1 Open challenges of YOLO versions

YOLO models have demonstrated significant effectiveness across various domains through
the development of SOTA models. These models achieve high accuracy while maintaining
real-time performance, as evidenced by their rapid inference times. However, it is impor-
tant to acknowledge that YOLO models still face challenges in handling occluded objects,
detecting small objects, and adapting to diverse deployment environments due to inherent
architectural constraints. Table 4 summarize the challenges faced by YOLO versions and
incorporated its performance value in MS COCO and PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and
Frames Per Second (FPS) value.

10.2.2 Emerging research directions in YOLO object detection

• Incorporation of newly developed techniques for data augmentation, training the model
  and integrating the best deep learning algorithm with YOLO variants will improve the
  robustness, performance and efficiency of the model [70].

                       limiting its ability to capture finer details
                     • Logistic loss function in YOLOv3 only penalizes the difference in area between predicted and ground-

                       which can affect its performance in target detection
     YOLOv6 [82]     • For label assignment, SimOTA is used, but it reduces the training process                                    43.1% on the MS COCO dataset        520
                     • Inference time is low compared to YOLOv5
                     • Evaluation is done on the COCO dataset, so testing on more diverse datasets with industrial-specific

• Detection of small object in an image and video is a challenging task in YOLO. Uti-
  lizing attention modules like Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks can improve feature
  representation and focus on relevant information.
• All the YOLO variants are evaluated only on MS COCO and Pascal VOC 2007, so
  making a transition from this dataset to a challenging dataset will definitely achieve an
  accurate and sophisticated model.
• Now YOLO focus on object detection, classification and segmentation process. YOLO
  have the potential to migrate to object tracking in real-time videos and estimate the 3D
  key points.
• Tailoring the YOLO model to high performance computing cluster will suit to different
  hardware conditions. This will enable the YOLO model easily accessible and effective
  to more areas and industries.
• Annotation in supervised data is done by humans nowadays, this will prone to error and
  time consuming. To overcome this unsupervised object detection is needed.
• Incorporating data from various sources, including the fusion of visual and textual
  information, aims to improve object detection accuracy and broaden its applicability
  across a range of scenarios.

11 Conclusion and future research

Object detection technology has become incredibly popular in the area of computer vision.
Object detection holds immense potential lies in the development of object detection
approaches for unseen objects and the optimization of existing techniques. This review pre-
sents the widely used and significant datasets, commonly used annotation tools, and appli-
cations that describe these datasets. Then this review deeply focused on different variations
and features carried out in different versions of YOLO along with architectural concepts
and also represented the challenges and enhancements of every version of YOLO. Future
research of my work is to improve YOLO performance, by integrating the ConvNeXt archi-
tecture into the backbone of YOLOv8 will increase the feature extraction capability. Focus-
ing research efforts on the discussed future enhancements improving the YOLO models
could lead to developing object detection systems with human-like accuracy.
