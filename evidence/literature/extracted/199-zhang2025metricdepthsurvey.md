                                                                                          Abstract

                                                      Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) enables spatial understanding, 3D reconstruc-
                                                      tion, and autonomous navigation, yet deep learning approaches often predict only
                                                      relative depth without a consistent metric scale. This limitation reduces reliability
                                                      in applications such as visual SLAM, precise 3D modeling, and view synthesis.
                                                      Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) overcomes this challenge by produc-
                                                      ing depth maps with absolute scale, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling
                                                      deployment without additional calibration. This survey reviews the evolution
                                                      of MMDE, from geometry-based methods to state-of-the-art deep models, with
                                                      emphasis on the datasets that drive progress. Key benchmarks, including KITTI,
                                                      NYU-D, ApolloScape, and TartanAir, are examined in terms of modality, scene
                                                      type, and application domain. Methodological advances are analyzed, covering
                                                      domain generalization, boundary preservation, and the integration of synthetic and
                                                      real data. Techniques such as unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, patch-
                                                      based inference, architectural innovations, and generative modeling are evaluated
                                                      for their strengths and limitations. By synthesizing current progress, highlight-
                                                      ing the importance of high-quality datasets, and identifying open challenges, this
                                                      survey provides a structured reference for advancing MMDE and supporting its
                                                      adoption in real-world computer vision systems.

                                         1       Preliminary

                                         Depth estimation reconstructs 3D scene structure from images and underpins numerous applications,
                                         including 3D reconstruction (Mildenhall et al., 2021; Kerbl et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2024), autonomous
                                         navigation (Szeliski, 2022), self-driving vehicles (Zheng et al., 2024), and video understanding (Leduc
                                         et al., 2024). It also supports emerging areas such as AI-generated content (AIGC), which spans
                                         image synthesis (Zhang et al., 2023; Khan et al., 2023), video generation (Liew et al., 2023), and 3D
                                         scene reconstruction (Xu et al., 2023; Shahbazi et al., 2024; Shriram et al., 2024).
                                         Classical approaches relied on parallax, stereo vision, and multi-camera systems. With advances
                                         in deep learning, monocular depth estimation (MDE) emerged as a cost-effective alternative that
                                         predicts depth from a single image. The field’s growing significance is reflected in the Monocular
                                         Depth Estimation Challenge (MDEC), hosted at CVPR in 2023 and 2024 and scheduled to return in
                                         20251 .
                                         Recent work has shifted toward Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE), which provides
                                         absolute depth values rather than scale-inconsistent maps. This shift is driven by practical require-
                                         ments for accurate, generalizable, and detail-preserving predictions in real-world tasks. Industry

large-scale datasets, high-performance computing, and novel architectures, enabling improvements in
zero-shot generalization and reconstruction fidelity.
However, survey literature remains limited. Most comprehensive reviews predate 2020 (Bhoi, 2019;
Khan et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Xiaogang et al., 2020), and recent work often focuses on domain-
specific settings (Lahiri et al., 2024; Tosi et al., 2024; Vyas et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2022) or relative
depth (Masoumian et al., 2022; Arampatzakis et al., 2023; Rajapaksha et al., 2024). Meanwhile,
leading venues such as CVPR 2024, ECCV 2024, and NeurIPS 2024 highlight emerging trends
in zero-shot MMDE and generative model integration. This paper fills a critical gap by offering a
comprehensive review of MMDE, addressing datasets, methodological advances, open challenges,
and future directions.

2     Depth Estimation
                                                                          H×W
The goal of depth estimation is to compute a depth map D := (R)               from a given 2D image
          H×W ×3
I := (R)          , where each depth value di,j ∈ D represents the physical distance between pixel
ii,j ∈ I and the camera (Bhat et al., 2021). This task is inherently ill-posed because 2D images are
projections of the 3D world, which discard geometric information. Monocular depth estimation is
particularly challenging due to the absence of parallax and auxiliary cues (Miangoleh et al., 2021).
Despite these challenges, depth estimation plays a critical role in computer vision (Jampani et al.,
2021). Accurate depth maps enhance scene understanding and object localization, which benefit a
wide range of applications. In autonomous driving and robotics, they improve obstacle detection, path
planning, and environmental awareness. In AR/VR, reliable depth predictions enable realistic 3D
reconstruction and immersive interaction. In computational photography, depth supports multi-focus
imaging, background segmentation, and 3D video synthesis (Eigen et al., 2014).
By providing dense, pixel-wise distance predictions, depth estimation equips intelligent systems with
geometric awareness of the environment. This capability remains a cornerstone of visual perception
research with substantial real-world impact across established and emerging domains.

2.1     Traditional Methods

Before the rise of deep learning, depth estimation primarily relied on geometric models and specialized
sensors. These approaches achieved accuracy in controlled conditions but often required additional
hardware and struggled in complex real-world environments (Singh et al., 2023).

2.1.1    Sensors
Early sensor-based systems directly captured spatial information. Structured-light devices, such as
Microsoft Kinect v1, projected predefined patterns to infer depth, while Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors
measured light travel time. Although accurate in laboratory settings, these methods were expensive
and highly sensitive to ambient light and surface properties, limiting their use in dynamic or portable
applications.

2.1.2    Stereo Vision
Stereo vision, inspired by human binocular perception, estimated depth from disparities between
two calibrated cameras. While effective, performance degraded in low-texture regions, poor lighting,
and dynamic scenes, where reliable pixel correspondence was difficult. The hardware complexity of
stereo rigs further restricted widespread deployment.

2.1.3    Geometric Multi-Frame Methods
Techniques such as Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) inferred depth from multi-frame parallax by estimating camera poses and reconstructing
3D point clouds. Indirect methods minimized reprojection error from feature correspondences,
while direct methods exploited photometric consistency (Wofk et al., 2023). Despite enabling depth
estimation without extra sensors, these methods were sensitive to illumination changes and texture
inconsistencies, reducing robustness in unconstrained environments.

                                                     2
Traditional approaches provided a strong foundation but were limited by hardware demands, envi-
ronmental constraints, and computational complexity. The shift to deep learning introduced more
scalable, flexible, and robust solutions, which now dominate depth estimation research.

2.2   Deep Learning

Deep learning has fundamentally reshaped depth estimation, replacing geometry-based methods
with learning-driven approaches. Unlike stereo or LiDAR-based systems, neural networks predict
depth directly from a single image, reducing hardware cost and enabling lightweight deployment in
applications such as mobile AR and drone navigation (Garg et al., 2016).
A major advantage of deep learning is its ability to leverage large-scale datasets to capture scene
priors that resolve the inherent ambiguity of monocular input. Neural networks learn both local
textures and global semantics, allowing inference of spatial relationships and geometric structure. For
example, sky regions are recognized as distant, while ground-plane textures provide depth gradients,
leading to more reliable predictions even in ill-posed regions.
Feature representation is central to modern models. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) extract
multi-scale information, integrating fine textures with high-level semantics to improve precision and
robustness in structured environments. This feature-driven paradigm surpasses pixel-based geometric
methods by achieving reliable performance across sparse-texture, cluttered, and dynamic scenes.
Deep learning thus enables scalable, cost-efficient, and robust monocular depth estimation, expanding
its impact on domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and immersive AR/VR systems.

3     Monocular Depth Estimation
Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) predicts scene depth from a single RGB image, eliminating
the need for multi-view setups or specialized sensors. Neural networks extract visual cues directly,
thereby reducing system complexity and cost compared to traditional geometry-based methods.
Early supervised approaches demonstrated the feasibility of learning depth from labeled datasets.
Eigen et al. introduced a multi-scale CNN that jointly predicted global and local depth, significantly
improving accuracy (Eigen et al., 2014). Their subsequent work incorporated surface normals and
semantic labels in a multi-task framework, further enhancing robustness (Eigen & Fergus, 2015).
Modern architectures largely adopt encoder–decoder designs, where encoders capture global context
and decoders reconstruct fine-grained depth. Multi-scale feature fusion strengthens the balance
between structure and detail. To mitigate the intrinsic ambiguity of monocular cues, several works
integrate geometric priors such as perspective constraints and object size, improving plausibility and
generalization.
Although early models often struggled with cross-domain transfer, advances in universal feature
extraction and domain-invariant learning have expanded MDE’s applicability in real-world scenarios.
These developments establish MDE as a practical and scalable solution for tasks requiring dense
depth perception.

4     Zero-shot Monocular Depth Estimation
Zero-shot MDE addresses the poor transferability of supervised models, which often rely on dataset-
specific scales and camera intrinsics. Early solutions reformulated the task as Relative Depth Estima-
tion (RDE), predicting ordinal pixel relationships rather than absolute distances. This scale-agnostic
formulation, coupled with scale-invariant and scale-and-shift-invariant loss functions, improved
generalization across heterogeneous datasets (Fu et al., 2018).
A major milestone was MiDaS (Birkl et al., 2023), which unified multi-dataset training under scale-
invariant objectives. By evolving from CNN-based designs to Vision Transformers (Han et al., 2022),
MiDaS demonstrated strong cross-domain performance, establishing a foundation for zero-shot depth
prediction. However, RDE inherently trades metric precision for generalization: while robust across
domains, it cannot provide absolute scale, limiting applications such as SLAM, AR, and autonomous
driving where metric consistency and temporal coherence are critical.

                                                  3
Recent research aims to bridge relative and metric estimation within unified frameworks, seeking to
balance robustness with scale fidelity. These efforts mark a shift toward zero-shot models that can
generalize across domains while remaining suitable for real-world deployment.

5     Monocular Metric Depth Estimation

Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) has gained prominence due to its ability to predict
absolute depth in physical units, enabling consistent 3D perception for applications such as recon-
struction, novel view synthesis, and SLAM. Unlike relative methods, MMDE ensures geometric
stability and temporal coherence across frames, making it more practical for real-world deployment.
Early approaches assumed known camera intrinsics. Metric3D mapped images to a canonical
space with focal length corrections (Yin et al., 2023), while ZeroDepth leveraged variational in-
ference with camera-specific embeddings (Guizilini et al., 2023). More recent work removes this
dependency by estimating intrinsics through auxiliary networks or predicting depth in spherical
representations (Spencer et al., 2024a).
Advances in adaptive binning have further improved accuracy. AdaBins introduced dynamic depth
bin allocation (Bhat et al., 2021), refined by LocalBins through spatial partitioning (Bhat et al.,
2022), while BinsFormer integrated Transformers for global-local bin optimization (Li et al., 2024c).
NeW CRFs combined neural networks with conditional random fields to enforce pixel-wise consis-
tency (Yuan et al., 2022).
A breakthrough in zero-shot MMDE was ZoeDepth (Bhat et al., 2023), which extended MiDaS
with adaptive metric binning and scene-aware routing, achieving strong cross-domain generalization
across indoor and outdoor datasets. This unified design has established a benchmark for scalable and
robust metric depth estimation.

6     Challenges and Improvements

Although MMDE has advanced significantly, generalization to unseen domains remains a primary
challenge (Spencer et al., 2024b). Models often suffer from geometric blurring, loss of fine details, and
degraded performance in high-resolution or cross-domain scenarios, limiting reliability in real-world
applications.
Recent improvements target these issues through architectural refinements, such as multi-scale feature
fusion and transformer-based designs, which better preserve structure and context. Enhanced training
strategies, including domain-invariant learning and large-scale multi-dataset supervision, improve
robustness across diverse environments. At inference, patch-based and adaptive mechanisms mitigate
resolution constraints while maintaining geometric consistency. Collectively, these advances have
boosted prediction accuracy and stability, yet achieving both high precision and strong generalization
in dynamic settings remains an open challenge for MMDE.

6.1   Generalizability

Improving the generalization of zero-shot MMDE relies on large-scale data augmentation, robust
architectures, and novel training paradigms.
Dataset Augmentation: Depth Anything employs a semi-supervised framework generating 62M
self-annotated images, enabling strong cross-domain adaptation through semantic priors and large-
scale supervision (Yang et al., 2024a; Marsal et al., 2024; Haji-Esmaeili & Montazer, 2024; Shao
et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024). Depth Any Camera (DAC) further extends depth estimation to fisheye
and 360° imagery using ERP, pitch-aware conversion, and field-of-view alignment, achieving robust
omnidirectional prediction (Guo et al., 2025).
Model Improvements: UniDepth predicts metric 3D point clouds without camera intrinsics via a
self-promptable camera module, pseudo-spherical outputs, and geometric invariance loss, enhancing
robustness to camera variations and domain shifts (Piccinelli et al., 2024).

Table 1: Timeline of key advancements in monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE). While most
generative approaches focus on relative depth, Diffusion for Metric Depth (DMD) remains the only
reported method producing absolute metric predictions (Saxena et al., 2023). However, the absence
of public release limits independent validation, leaving the role of generative models in MMDE an
open avenue for future exploration.

Loss and Training Paradigms: DepthAnything-AC introduces unsupervised consistency regular-
ization and a Spatial Distance Constraint, reducing noise sensitivity and improving fine-structure
preservation in degraded conditions (Sun et al., 2025).

6.2   Blurriness

Depth estimation models often suffer from blurred edges and loss of fine details, particularly around
object boundaries, occlusions, and high-frequency textures. This degradation reduces structural
accuracy and limits applicability in high-precision tasks.
Patch-based methods improve detail by combining local and global cues. BoostingDepth and
PatchFusion use multi-resolution fusion to enhance sharpness, though at high computational cost (Mi-
angoleh et al., 2021; Li et al., 2024a). PatchRefiner introduces Detail and Scale Disentangling
(DSD) loss and pseudo-labeling to sharpen boundaries while improving efficiency (Li et al., 2024b).
DepthPro further balances detail and speed through a multi-scale Vision Transformer with patch
slicing, though with reduced accuracy in distant regions (Bochkovskii et al., 2024).
Synthetic datasets provide pixel-accurate labels for training, reducing boundary artifacts. Depth
Anything V2 leverages synthetic supervision with pseudo-labeling and gradient-matching loss to
bridge domain gaps, enhancing fine detail and robustness (Yang et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024b).
Generative diffusion methods restore structural fidelity through progressive refinement. Marigold
achieves sharper predictions in reflective and transparent regions (Ke et al., 2024), while GeoWizard
introduces scene-aware decoupling and normal map integration for improved 3D geometry (Fu et al.,
2024). DeepMind’s DMD applies logarithmic depth parameterization and FOV conditioning to
resolve scale ambiguities and accelerate inference (Saxena et al., 2023).

6.3   Incremental Sensor Assistance

Lightweight sensor cues have been explored as auxiliary signals to improve monocular metric depth
estimation. Lin et al. (Lin et al., 2025) propose incorporating sparse LiDAR data as incremental
prompts within a depth decoder, guiding pre-trained foundation models toward more accurate and
high-resolution metric predictions. This hybrid strategy leverages minimal sensor input while
retaining the scalability of purely vision-based approaches.

6.4   Analysis and Comparison

Single-inference methods dominate monocular depth estimation due to their efficiency, producing
depth in a single forward pass suitable for real-time tasks such as navigation and view synthesis.
However, these models often lose fine structural details and rely heavily on large-scale, high-quality
annotations, limiting generalization in noisy real-world datasets.

substantial performance variation. The absence of standardized datasets, training protocols, and
model settings continues to hinder fair cross-model comparison.

Patch-based strategies improve resolution by processing local regions independently and fusing
results, enabling finer structural recovery. Methods like PatchFusion enhance accuracy via optimized
patch weighting, but inference scales with patch count, causing latency that restricts deployment in
high-resolution or time-critical scenarios (Li et al., 2024a).
Generative diffusion models offer an alternative by progressively refining depth predictions, capturing
complex geometries with strong structural consistency (Ke et al., 2024). While effective in detail
preservation and less reliant on labeled data, their multi-step denoising introduces computational
overhead and variability. Most focus on relative depth, with limited exploration of monocular metric
depth estimation (MMDE). Notably, DMD incorporates field-of-view conditioning and log-scale
parameterization to achieve accurate zero-shot MMDE (Saxena et al., 2023), though inference
inefficiency remains a bottleneck.
In summary, single-inference methods trade detail for speed, patch-based methods improve accuracy
at high cost, and generative models offer superior fidelity but face scalability challenges.

7    Datasets for MMDE

A wide range of datasets, as shown in Table 3, supports monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE),
with outdoor collections dominating due to their relevance to autonomous driving. Benchmarks such
as KITTI, Waymo Open Dataset, and nuScenes provide rich multi-sensor data—including RGB,
LiDAR, and radar—offering reliable metric depth for training and evaluation (Geiger et al., 2013;
Caesar et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020).
Indoor datasets, though fewer, are vital for robotics and AR applications. Notable examples include
ScanNet, NYU Depth V2, and SUN RGB-D, which supply high-quality RGB-D imagery and accurate
ground truth (Dai et al., 2017; Silberman et al., 2012; Song et al., 2015).
Synthetic datasets such as TartanAir, Hypersim, and vKITTI provide pixel-perfect, noise-free depth
maps, complementing real-world datasets by enabling large-scale, diverse, and controlled training
scenarios (Wang et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2021; Gaidon et al., 2016). These resources are
increasingly leveraged to mitigate annotation errors and domain gaps in real-world data.
Dataset diversity also extends to sensor configurations, from RGB-only captures to multi-modal
setups integrating LiDAR, GPS, and IMU. Crucially, most reviewed datasets (32 of 38) provide true
metric depth, while a smaller subset offers only relative depth, which remains useful in scale-agnostic
applications.
In summary, real-world driving datasets dominate current MMDE research, indoor datasets provide
indispensable complementary supervision, and synthetic datasets enhance diversity and precision,
together forming the backbone of benchmarking and training.

8       Summary and Outlook
MMDE has evolved from traditional architectures toward generative modeling and domain-
generalizable frameworks. Tables 1 and 2 highlight art methods and performance benchmarks,
illustrating progress in both architectural design and data utilization. These advances have broadened
the applicability to 3D reconstruction, navigation, and interactive perception. Nonetheless, challenges
remain, including fine-detail preservation, geometric consistency in complex scenes, and the trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency (Spencer et al., 2024b; Yang et al., 2024a).
Loss design continues to play a critical role, with edge-aware and gradient-based formulations
improving structural fidelity, while generative supervision further enhances robustness (Sun et al.,
2025). Data strategies combining real-world and synthetic datasets (Wang et al., 2020; Roberts et al.,
2021) mitigate annotation scarcity and domain gaps, offering a scalable foundation for generalization.
Generative diffusion models, such as Marigold and GeoWizard, show strong potential in recovering
high-frequency details and complex geometries, while DMD introduces field-of-view conditioning
and log-scale parameterization for improved adaptability (Bochkovskii et al., 2024). Although diffu-
sion methods remain computationally demanding, optimization of multi-step inference is advancing
toward practical deployment.
A clear research trend is zero-shot generalization across unseen domains. Approaches like ZoeDepth
and UniDepth (Piccinelli et al., 2024) demonstrate promising transferability through architectural
innovations and large-scale training. Looking forward, priorities include improving computational
efficiency, enforcing geometric consistency in multi-view settings, and advancing domain adaptation.
MMDE is moving toward becoming a cornerstone of spatial perception, with ongoing innovations
in loss functions, hybrid data pipelines, and generative modeling steadily pushing the field toward
universal, accurate, and efficient depth estimation.
Table 3: Overview of depth estimation datasets commonly used in computer vision. Datasets
providing metric depth (e.g., NYU-D, KITTI, ApolloScape) supply RGB–depth pairs for supervised
MMDE, while relative depth datasets (e.g., DIW, Movies, WSVD) support ordinal depth prediction.
Synthetic and hybrid datasets (e.g., BlendedMVS, TartanAir (Wang et al., 2020)) augment real-world
data and aid domain adaptation. Columns summarize dataset name, scene type (indoor/outdoor),
driving relevance, synthetic/real origin, supported tasks, available modalities, supervision type, and
key features, facilitating selection for applications ranging from autonomous driving to indoor scene
understanding.
