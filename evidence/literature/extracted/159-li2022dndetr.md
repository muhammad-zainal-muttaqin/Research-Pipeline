                                             Abstract—We present in this paper a novel denoising training method to speed up DETR (DEtection TRansformer) training and offer a
                                             deepened understanding of the slow convergence issue of DETR-like methods. We show that the slow convergence results from the
                                             instability of bipartite graph matching which causes inconsistent optimization goals in early training stages. To address this issue,

                                             the model to reconstruct the original boxes, which effectively reduces the bipartite graph matching difficulty and leads to faster
                                             convergence. Our method is universal and can be easily plugged into any DETR-like method by adding dozens of lines of code to

                                            Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vi-
                                        sion that aims to predict the bounding boxes and classes
                                        of objects in an image. While having made remarkable
                                        progress, classical detectors [18], [17] were mainly based
                                        on convolutional neural networks, until Carion et al. [1]
                                        recently introduced Transformers [20] into object detection
                                        and proposed DETR (DEtection TRansformer).
                                            In contrast to previous detectors, DETR uses learnable

Fig. 6. The overview of our training method. There are two parts of queries, namely the denoising part and the matching part. The denoising part
contains ≥ 1 denoising groups. The attention masks from the matching part to the denoising part and among denoising groups are set to 1 (block)
to block information leakage. In the figure, the yellow, brown and green grids in the attention mask represent 0 (unblock) and grey grids represent 1
