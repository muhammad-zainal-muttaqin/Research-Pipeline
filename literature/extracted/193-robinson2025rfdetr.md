                                                 weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR,
                                                 a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency

                                                 (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset
                                                 and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency
                                                 tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the “tunable knobs” for NAS
                                                 to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably,
                                                 RF-DETR significantly improves over prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on
                                                 COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO,
                                                 beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large)
                                                 outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while run-

                                                 real-time detector to surpass 60 AP on COCO. Our code is available on GitHub.

                                        1   I NTRODUCTION
                                        Object detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision that has matured in recent
                                        years (Felzenszwalb et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2015). Open-vocabulary detectors
                                        like GroundingDINO (Liu et al., 2023) and YOLO-World (Cheng et al., 2024) achieve remarkable
                                        zero-shot performance on common categories like car, truck, and pedestrian. However,
                                        state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution
                                        classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically found in their pre-training (Robicheaux et al.,
                                        2025). Fine-tuning VLMs on a target dataset significantly improves in-domain performance at the
                                        cost of runtime efficiency (due to heavy-weight text encoders) and open-vocabulary generalization.
                                        In contrast, specialist (i.e., closed-vocabulary) object detectors like D-FINE (Peng et al., 2024) and
                                        RT-DETR (Zhao et al., 2024) achieve real-time inference, but underperform fined-tuned VLMs like
                                        GroundingDINO. In this paper, we modernize specialist detectors by combining internet-scale pre-
                                        training with real-time architectures to achieve state-of-the-art performance and fast inference.
                                        Are Specialist Detectors Over-Optimized for COCO? Sustained progress in object detection can
                                        be largely attributed to standardized benchmarks like PASCAL VOC (Everingham et al., 2015)
                                        and COCO (Lin et al., 2014). However, we find that recent specialist detectors implicitly overfit
                                        to COCO at the cost of real-world performance using bespoke model architectures, learning rate
                                        schedulers, and augmentation schedulers. Notably, state-of-the-art object detectors like YOLOv8
                                        (Jocher et al., 2023) generalize poorly to real-world datasets with significantly different data distri-
                                        butions from COCO (e.g., number of objects per image, number of classes, and dataset size). To
                                        address these limitations, we present RF-DETR, a scheduler-free approach that leverages internet-
                                        scale pre-training to generalize to real-world data distributions. To better specialize our model for
                                        diverse hardware platforms and dataset characteristics, we revisit neural architecture search (NAS)
                                        in the context of end-to-end object detection and segmentation.

sub-components like detector backbones Tan et al. (2020) and FPNs Ghiasi et al. (2019). Unlike
prior work, we explore end-to-end weight-sharing NAS for object detection and segmentation. Our
key insight, inspired by OFA (Cai et al., 2019), is that we can vary model inputs like image reso-
lution, and architectural components like patch size during training. Further, weight-sharing NAS
allows us to modify inference configurations like the number of decoder layers and query tokens
to specialize our strong base model without fine-tuning. We evaluate all model configurations with
grid search on a validation set. Importantly, our approach does not evaluate the search space un-
til the base model has been fully-trained on the target dataset. As a result, all possible sub-nets
(i.e., model configurations within the search space) achieve strong performance without further fine-
tuning, significantly reducing the computational cost of optimizing for new hardware. Interestingly,
we find that sub-nets not explicitly seen during training still achieve high performance (Appendix F),
suggesting that RF-DETR can generalize to unseen architectures. Extending RF-DETR for segmen-
tation is also relatively straightforward and only requires adding a lightweight instance segmentation
head. We denote this model as RF-DETR-Seg. Notably, this allows us to also leverage end-to-end
weight-sharing NAS to discover Pareto optimal architectures for real-time instance segmentation.
Standardizing Latency Evaluation. We evaluate our approach on COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and
Roboflow100-VL (RF100-VL) (Robicheaux et al., 2025) and achieve state-of-the-art performance
among real-time detectors. RF-DETR (nano) outperforms D-FINE (nano) by 5% AP on COCO
at comparable run-times, and RF-DETR (2x-large) beats GroundingDINO (tiny) on RF100-VL at a
fraction of the runtime. RF-DETR-Seg (nano) outperforms YOLOv11-Seg (x-large) on COCO while
running 4 × as fast. However, comparing RF-DETR’s latency with prior work remains challenging
because reported latency evaluation varies significantly between papers. Notably, each new model
re-benchmarks the latency of prior work for fair comparison on their hardware. For example, D-
FINE’s reported latency evaluation of LW-DETR (Chen et al., 2024a) is 25% faster than originally
reported. We identify that this lack of reproducibility can be primarily attributed to GPU power
throttling during inference. We find that buffering between forward passes limits power over-draw
and standardizes latency evaluation (Table 1).
Contributions. We present three major contributions. First, we introduce RF-DETR, a family of
scheduler-free NAS-based detection and segmentation models that outperform prior state-of-the-art
on RF100-VL (Robicheaux et al., 2025) and real-time methods with latencies ≤ 40 ms on COCO
(Lin et al., 2014) (Figure 1). To the best of our knowledge, RF-DETR is the first real-time detector
to exceed 60 mAP on COCO. Next, we explore the “tunable-knobs” for weight-sharing NAS to
improve accuracy-latency tradeoffs for end-to-end object detection (Figure 3). Notably, our use of a
weight-sharing NAS allows us to leverage large-scale pre-training and effectively transfer to small
datasets (Table 4). Lastly, we revisit current benchmarking protocols for measuring latency and
propose a simple standardized procedure to improve reproducibility.

2   R ELATED W ORKS

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automatically identifies families of model architectures with
different accuracy-latency tradeoffs (Zoph & Le, 2016; Zoph et al., 2018; Real et al., 2019; Cai et al.,
2018a). Early NAS approaches (Zoph & Le, 2016; Real et al., 2019) focused primarily on maxi-
mizing accuracy, with little consideration for efficiency. As a result, discovered architectures (e.g.,
NASNet and AmoebaNet) were often computationally expensive. More recent hardware-aware NAS
methods (Cai et al., 2018b; Tan et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019) address this limitation by incorporating
hardware feedback directly into the search process. However, these methods must repeat the search
and training process for each new hardware platform. In contrast, OFA (Cai et al., 2019) proposes a
weight-sharing NAS that decouples training and search by simultaneously optimizing thousands of
sub-nets with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs. Contemporary methods typically evaluate NAS
for object detection by simply replacing standard backbones with NAS backbones in existing detec-
tion frameworks. Unlike prior work, we directly optimize end-to-end object detection accuracy to
find Pareto optimal accuracy-latency tradeoffs for any target dataset.
Real-Time Object Detectors are of significant interest for safety-critical and interactive applica-
tions. Historically, two-stage detectors like Mask-RCNN (He et al., 2017) and Hybrid Task Cascade
(Chen et al., 2019) achieved state-of-the-art performance at the cost of latency, while single-stage
detectors like YOLO (Redmon et al., 2016) and SSD (Liu et al., 2016) traded accuracy for state-

Figure 1: Accuracy-Latency Pareto Curve. We plot the Pareto accuracy-latency frontier for real-
time detectors on the COCO detection val-set (top left, bottom left), COCO segmentation val-set
(top right), and RF100-VL test-set (bottom right). Since RF100-VL contains 100 distinct datasets,
we select target latencies for the N, S, M, L, XL, 2XL configurations, search for RF-DETR models
with latencies within 10% of the target and report their average performance after fine-tuning to
convergence. Importantly, all points along RF-DETR’s continuous Pareto curves for COCO are

of-the-art runtime. However, modern detectors (Zhao et al., 2024) reexamine this accuracy-latency
tradeoff, simultaneously improving on both axes. Recent YOLO variants innovate on architecture,
data augmentation, and training techniques (Redmon et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2023; 2024; Jocher
et al., 2023; 2024) to improve performance while maintaining fast inference. Despite their effi-
ciency, most YOLO models rely on non-maximum suppression (NMS), which introduces additional
latency. In contrast, DETR (Carion et al., 2020) removes hand-crafted components like NMS and
anchor boxes. However, early DETR variants (Zhu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022a; Meng et al.,
2021; Liu et al., 2022) achieved strong accuracy at the cost of runtime, limiting their use in real-
time applications. Recent works such as RT-DETR (Zhao et al., 2024) and LW-DETR (Chen et al.,
2024a) have successfully adapted high performance DETRs for real-time applications. Building on
LW-DETR, RF-DETR is the first real-time detector to achieve more than 60 AP on COCO.
Vision-Language Models are trained on large-scale, weakly supervised image-text pairs from the
web. Such internet-scale pre-training is a key enabler for open-vocabulary object detection (Liu
et al., 2023; Cheng et al., 2024). GLIP (Li et al., 2022) frames detection as phrase grounding with
a single text query, while Detic (Zhou et al., 2022) boosts long-tail detection using ImageNet-level
supervision (Russakovsky et al., 2015). MQ-Det (Xu et al., 2024) extends GLIP with a learnable
module that enables multi-modal prompting. Recent VLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot perfor-
mance and are often applied as black-box models in diverse downstream tasks (Ma et al., 2023; Peri
et al., 2023; Khurana et al., 2024; Osep et al., 2024; Takmaz et al., 2025). However, Robicheaux
et al. (2025) find that such models perform poorly when evaluated on categories not typically found
in their pre-training, requiring further fine-tuning. In addition, many vision-language models are
prohibitively slow, making them difficult to use for real-time tasks. In contrast, RF-DETR combines
the fast inference of real-time detectors with the internet-scale priors of VLMs to achieve state-of-
the-art performance on RF100-VL and at all latencies ≤ 40 ms on COCO.

Figure 2: RF-DETR Architecture. RF-DETR uses a pre-trained ViT backbone to extract multi-
scale features of the input image. We interleave windowed and non-windowed attention blocks to
balance accuracy and latency. Notably, the deformable cross-attention layer and segmentation head
both bilinearly interpolate the output of the projector, allowing for consistent spatial organization
of features. Lastly, we apply detection and segmentation losses at all decoder layers to facilitate
decoder drop out at inference.

3   RF-DETR: W EIGHT-S HARING NAS W ITH F OUNDATION M ODELS

In this section, we describe the architecture of our base model (Figure 2) and present the “tunable
knobs” of our weight-sharing NAS (Figure 3). Further, we highlight the limitations of hand-designed
learning-rate and augmentation schedulers, and advocate for a scheduler-free approach.
Incorporating Internet-Scale Priors. RF-DETR modernizes LW-DETR (Chen et al., 2024a) by
simplifying its architecture and training procedure to improve generalization to diverse target do-
mains. First, we replace LW-DETR’s CAEv2 (Zhang et al., 2022b) backbone with DINOv2 (Oquab
et al., 2023). We find that initializing our backbone with DINOv2’s pre-trained weights significantly
improves detection accuracy on small datasets. Notably, CAEv2’s encoder has 10 layers with a
patch size of 16, while DINOv2’s encoder has 12 layers. Our DINOv2 backbone has more layers
and is slower than CAEv2, but we make up for this latency using NAS (discussed next). Lastly, we
facilitate training on consumer-grade GPUs via gradient accumulation by using layer norm instead
of batch norm in the multi-scale projector.
Real-Time Instance Segmentation. Inspired by Li et al. (2023), we add a lightweight instance
segmentation head to jointly predict high quality segmentation masks. Our segmentation head bi-
linearly interpolates the output of the encoder and learns a lightweight projector to generate a pixel
embedding map. Specifically, we upsample the same low-resolution feature map for the detection
and segmentation heads to ensure that it contains relevant spatial information. Unlike MaskDINO
(Li et al., 2023), we do not incorporate multi-scale backbone features in our segmentation head to
minimize latency. Lastly, we compute the dot product of all projected query token embeddings (at
the output of each decoder layer transformed by a FFN) with the pixel embedding map to gener-
ate segmentation masks. Interestingly, we can interpret these pixel embeddings as segmentation

queries, (d) image resolution, and (e) number of windows per attention block when evaluating dif-
ferent operating points along RF-DETR’s Pareto curve. In addition to training thousands of network

improves generalization.

prototypes (Bolya et al., 2019). Motivated by LW-DETR’s observation that pre-training improves
DETRs, we pre-train RF-DETR-Seg on Objects-365 (Shao et al., 2019) psuedo-labeled with SAM2
(Ravi et al., 2024) instance masks.
End-to-End Neural Architecture Search. Our weight-sharing NAS evaluates thousands of model
configurations with different input image resolutions, patch sizes, window attention blocks, decoder
layers, and query tokens. At every training iteration, we uniformly sample a random model con-
figuration and perform a gradient update (Appendix A). This allows our model to efficiently train
thousands of sub-nets in parallel, similar to ensemble learning with dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014).
We find that this weight-sharing NAS approach also serves as a regularizer during training, effec-
tively performing “architecture augmentation”. To the best of our knowledge, RF-DETR is the first
end-to-end weight-sharing NAS applied to object detection and segmentation. We describe each
component below.

        • Patch Size. Smaller patches lead to higher accuracy at greater computational cost. We
          adopt a FlexiVIT-style (Beyer et al., 2023) transformation to interpolate between patch
          sizes during training.
        • Number of Decoder Layers. Similar to recent DETRs (Peng et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024),
          we apply a regression loss to the output of all decoder layers during training. Therefore,
          we can drop any (or all) decoder blocks during inference. Interestingly, removing the entire
          decoder during inference effectively turns RF-DETR into a single-stage detector. Notably,
          truncating the decoder also shrinks the size of the segmentation branch, allowing for greater
          control over segmentation latency.
        • Number of Query Tokens. Query tokens learn spatial priors for bounding box regression
          and segmentation. We drop query tokens (ordered by the maximum sigmoid of the corre-
          sponding class logit per token at the output of the encoder, see Appendix B) at test time to
          vary the maximum number of detections and reduce inference latency. The Pareto optimal
          number of query tokens implicitly encodes dataset statistics about the average number of
          objects per image in a target dataset.

                                                                             5

       • Image Resolution. Higher resolution improves small object detection performance, while
         lower resolution improves runtime. We pre-allocate N positional embeddings correspond-
         ing to the largest image resolution divided by the smallest patch size and interpolate these
         embeddings for smaller resolutions or larger patch sizes.
       • Number of Windows per Windowed Attention Block. Window attention restricts self-
         attention to only process a fixed number of neighboring tokens. We can add or remove
         windows per block to balance accuracy, global information mixing, and computational ef-
         ficiency.

At inference time, we pick a specific model configuration to select an operating point on the
accuracy-latency Pareto curve. Importantly, different model configurations may have similar pa-
rameter counts but significantly different latencies. Similar to Cai et al. (2019), we see little benefit
from fine-tuning the NAS-mined models on COCO (Appendix G), but note modest improvements
from fine-tuning NAS-mined models on RF100-VL. This additional fine-tuning is optional, and is
often unnecessary for practical deployment. We posit that RF-DETR benefits from additional fine-
tuning on RF100-VL because the “architecture augmentation” regularization requires more than 100
epochs to converge on small datasets. Notably, prior weight-sharing NAS methods (Cai et al., 2019)
train in stages and use a different learning-rate scheduler per-stage. However, such schedulers make
strict assumptions about model convergence, which may not hold across diverse datasets.
Training Schedulers and Augmentations Bias Model Performance. State-of-the-art detectors
often require careful hyper-parameter tuning to maximize performance on standard benchmarks.
However, such bespoke training procedures implicitly bias the model towards certain dataset char-
acteristics (e.g. number of images). Concurrent with DINOv3 (Siméoni et al., 2025), we ob-
serve that cosine schedules assume a known (fixed) optimization horizon, which is impractical
for diverse target datasets like those in RF100-VL. Data augmentations introduce similar biases
by presuming prior knowledge of dataset properties. For example, prior work leverages aggres-
sive data augmentation (e.g., VerticalFlip, RandomFlip, RandomResize, RandomCrop,
YOLOXHSVRandomAug, and CachedMixUp) to increase effective dataset size. However, cer-
tain augmentations like VerticalFlip may negatively bias model predictions in safety-critical
domains. For example, a person detector in a self-driving vehicle should not be trained with
VerticalFlip to avoid false positive detections from reflections in puddles. Therefore, we limit
augmentations to horizontal flips and random crops. Lastly, LW-DETR applies a per-image random
resize augmentation, where each image is padded to match the largest image in the batch. As a
result, most images have significant padding, which introduces window artifacts, and wastes com-
putation on padded regions. In contrast, we resize images at the batch level to minimize the number
of padded pixels per-batch and to ensure that all positional encoding resolutions are equally likely
to be seen at train time.

4   E XPERIMENTS

We evaluate RF-DETR on COCO and RF100-VL and demonstrate that our approach achieves state-
of-the-art accuracy among all real-time methods. In addition, we identify inconsistencies in standard
benchmarking protocols and present a simple standardized procedure to improve reproducibility.
Following LW-DETR (Chen et al., 2024a), we group models of similar latency into the same size
bucket rather than grouping based on parameter count.
Datasets and Metrics. We evaluate RF-DETR on COCO for fair comparison with prior work
and on RF100-VL to evaluate generalization to real-world datasets with significantly different data
distributions. Due to the diversity of RF100-VL’s 100 datasets, we posit that overall performance
on this benchmark is a proxy for transferability to any target domain. We use pycocotools to report
standard metrics like mean average precision (mAP) and provide breakdown analysis for AP50 ,
AP75 , APSmall , APM edium , and APLarge . Further, we evaluate efficiency by measuring GFLOPs,
number of parameters, and inference latency on an NVIDIA T4 GPU with Tensor-RT 10.4 and
CUDA 12.4.
Standardizing Latency Benchmarking. Despite its maturity, benchmarking object detectors re-
mains inconsistent across prior work. For example, YOLO-based models often omit non-maximal
suppression (NMS) when computing latency, leading to unfair comparisons with end-to-end detec-

Table 1: Standardizing Latency Evaluation. Variance in latency measurements can be largely
attributed to power throttling and GPU overheating. We mitigate this issue by buffering for 200ms
between forward passes. Notably, this benchmarking approach is not designed to measure sustained
throughput, but rather ensures reproducible latency measurements. We are unable to reproduce
YOLOv8 and YOLOv11’s mAP results in TensorRT, likely because these models evaluate with
multi-class NMS but only use single-class NMS in inference. We use the standard NMS-tuned con-
fidence threshold of 0.01. YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 performance degrades further when quantizied
from FP32 to FP16, reaffirming that all models should report latency and accuracy using the same
model artifact. Notably, naively quantizing D-FINE to FP16 reduces performance to 0.5 AP. We fix
this issue by changing the authors’ export code to use ONNX opset 17 (Appendix A).

vocabulary object detectors below. We find that RF-DETR (nano) outperforms D-FINE (nano) and
LW-DETR (tiny) by more than 5 AP. RF-DETR significantly outperforms YOLOv8 and YOLOv11,
while RF-DETR’s nano size achieves performance parity with YOLOv8 and YOLOv11’s medium
size model. We denote models that do not support TensorRT execution with a star, and instead report
PyTorch latency results. See Appendix E for L, XL, and Max variants of RF-DETR on COCO.

tors. Additionally, YOLO-based segmentation models measure the latency of generating prototype
predictions instead of directly usable per-object masks (Jocher et al., 2024), leading to biased run-
time measurements. Further, D-FINE’s reported latency evaluation of LW-DETR is 25% faster than
reported by Chen et al. (2024b). We observe that such differences can be attributed to detectable
power throttling events, particularly when the GPU overheats (Table 1). In contrast, simply pausing
for 200ms between consecutive forward passes largely mitigates power throttling, yielding more sta-
ble latency measurements (Appendix K). Lastly, we find that prior work often reports latency using
FP16 quantized models, but evaluates accuracy with FP32 models. However, naive quantization can
significantly degrade performance (in some cases dropping performance to near 0 AP). To ensure
fair comparison, we advocate for reporting accuracy and latency with the same model artifact. We
release our stand-alone benchmarking tool on GitHub.
Evaluating RF-DETR and RF-DETR-Seg on COCO. COCO (Lin et al., 2014) is a flagship
benchmark for object detection and instance segmentation. In Table 2, we compare RF-DETR with
leading real-time and open-vocabulary detectors. RF-DETR (nano) beats both D-FINE (nano) and
LW-DETR (nano) by more than 5 AP. We see similar trends for small and medium sizes as well. No-

Table 3: COCO Instance Segmentation Evaluation. We compare RF-DETR with popular real-
time instance segmentation methods on COCO. Notably, RF-DETR (nano) outperforms all re-
ported YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 model sizes. Further RF-DETR (nano) outperforms FastInst by
5.4%, while running nearly ten times faster. RF-DETR (medium) approaches the performance on
MaskDINO at a fraction of the runtime. We denote models that do not support TensorRT execution
with a star, and instead report PyTorch latency results. Our latencies for YOLOs also include the
conversion of protos into masks, which are not typically included in prior benchmarks but nonethe-
less contribute meaningfully to practical latency. See Appendix E for L, XL, and Max variants of
RF-DETR-Seg on COCO.

tably, RF-DETR also significantly outperforms YOLOv8 and YOLOv11. RF-DETR (nano) matches
the performance of YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 (medium). We use mmdetection’s implementation of
GroundingDINO and include their reported AP since they do not release a model artifact for Ground-
ingDINO fine-tuned on COCO. We benchmark mmGroundingDINO’s parameter count, GFLOPS,
and latency using the released open-vocabulary model. In Table 3, we compare RF-DETR-Seg
with real-time instance segmentation models. RF-DETR-Seg (nano) outperforms YOLOv8 and
YOLOv11 at all sizes. Furthermore, RF-DETR-Seg (nano) beats FastInst by 5.4% while running
almost ten times faster. Similarly, RF-DETR (x-large) surpasses GroundingDINO (tiny), and RF-
DETR-Seg (large) outperforms MaskDINO (R50), at a fraction of their runtime.
Evaluating RF-DETR on RF100-VL. RF100-VL is a challenging detection benchmark composed
of 100 diverse datasets. We report latencies, FLOPs, and accuracy averaged over all 100 datasets in
Table 4. Our results show that RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO and LLMDet
while requiring only a fraction of their runtime. Interestingly, RT-DETR outperforms D-FINE
(which is built on RT-DETR) at AP50 , indicating that D-FINE’s hyperparameters are potentially
overfit to COCO. We also note that RF-DETR benefits from scaling to larger backbone sizes (Ap-
pendix E). In contrast, YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 consistently underperform DETR-based detectors,
and scaling these model families to larger sizes does not improve their performance on RF100-VL
(Figure 1).
Impact of Neural Architecture Search. We ablate the impact of weight-sharing NAS in Table 3.
We find that adopting a gentler set of hyperparameters compared to LW-DETR (e.g. larger batch
size, lower learning rate, and replacing batch normalization with layer normalization) reduces per-
formance over LW-DETR by 1.0%. Notably, replacing batch normalization with layer normalization
hurts performance, but is necessary to train on consumer hardware. However, replacing LW-DETR’s
CAEv2 backbone with DINOv2 improves performance by 2%. The lower learning rate, in partic-
ular, helps preserve DINOv2’s pre-trained knowledge, while additional epochs of Objects-365 pre-
training further compensate for the slower optimization. Our final model with weight-sharing NAS
improves over LW-DETR by 2% without increasing latency.
Impact of Backbone Architecture and Pre-Training. We study the impact of different backbone
architectures in RF-DETR. We find that DINOv2 achieves the best performance, outperforming
CAEv2 by 2%. Interestingly, despite having fewer parameters than SigLIPv2, SAM2’s Hiera-S
backbone is considerably slower. This is in contrast with Hiera’s claim that it is meaningfully faster
than equivalently performant ViTs. However, Hiera does not explore latency in the context of Flash
Attention kernels, which are highly optimized in compilers such as TensorRT. Additionally, existing

Table 4: RF100-VL Evaluation. We compare RF-DETR with real-time and open-vocabulary object
detectors on RF100-VL. Interestingly, RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny),
and LLMDet (tiny) at a fraction of their runtime. We report the average latency and FLOPs over
all 100 datasets. We note that YOLOv8 and YOLOv11’s latency measurements may be suboptimal
because the default tuned NMS threshold of 0.01 may not work well for all datasets in RF100-VL.
We denote models that do not support TensorRT execution with a star, and instead report PyTorch
latency results. See Appendix E for L, XL, and Max variants of RF-DETR on RF100-VL.

Table 5: Ablation on Neural Architecture Search. We ablate the impact of each “tunable knob”
on accuracy and latency below. Using a gentler set of hyperparameters compared to LW-DETR (e.g.
smaller batch size, lower learning rate, replacing batch norm with layer norm) reduces performance
by 1%. However, we regain this lost performance by replacing LW-DETR’s CAEV2 backbone with
DINOv2. Importantly, the lower learning rate and layer-norm allow us to better preserve DINOv2’s
foundational knowledge and allows us to train with larger batch sizes, making weight-sharing NAS
more effective. Counterintuitively, introducing weight sharing NAS to the training scheme improves
the performance of the base configuration even though patch size 14 isn’t in the NAS search space.

foundation model families typically do not release lightweight ViT variants such as ViT-S or ViT-T,
making it difficult to repurpose such models for real-time applications.
Rethinking Standard Accuracy Benchmarking Practices. Following prior work, we report all
COCO results on the validation set. However, relying solely on the validation for both model se-
lection and evaluation can lead to overfitting. For example, D-FINE (which builds on RT-DETR)
conducts an extensive hyperparameter sweep on COCO’s validation set and reports its best model.
However, evaluating this configuration on RF100-VL shows that D-FINE underperforms RT-DETR
on the test set. In contrast, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among all real-time de-
tectors on both RF100-VL and COCO, demonstrating the robustness of our weight-sharing NAS. In

Table 6: Ablation on Backbone. We ablate the impact of using different backbone architectures for
RF-DETR below. We find that DINOv2 achieves the highest performance, outperforming CAEv2 by
2.4%. All models are pretrained with 60 epochs of Objects-365 and the “Gentler Hyperparameters”
setting. Note that SAM2 and SigLIPv2 perform poorly when evaluated in FP16. Therefore, we
report FP16 TensorRT latency with FP32 ONNX accuracy for these two models as an upper bound
on their performance if optimized for FP16.

addition to evaluating on COCO, we advocate that future detectors should also evaluate on datasets
with public validation and test splits like RF100-VL.
Limitations. Despite controlling for power throttling and GPU overheating during inference, our
latency measurements still have a variance of up to 0.1ms due to the non-deterministic behavior of
TensorRT during compilation. Specifically, TensorRT can introduce power throttling, which in turn
affects the resulting engine and leads to random fluctuations in latency. Although the measurement
of a given TensorRT engine is generally consistent, recompiling the same ONNX artifact can pro-
duce slightly different latency results. Therefore, we only report latencies with one digit of precision
after the decimal place.

5   C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduce RF-DETR, a state-of-the-art NAS-based method for fine-tuning special-
ist end-to-end object detectors for diverse target datasets and hardware platforms. Our approach
outperforms prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and RF100-VL, improving upon D-
FINE (nano) by 5% AP on COCO. Moreover, we highlight that current architectures, learning rate
schedulers and augmentation schedulers are tailored to maximize performance on COCO, suggest-
ing that the community should benchmark models on diverse, large-scale datasets to prevent implicit
overfitting. Lastly, we highlight the high variance in latency benchmarking due to power throttling
and propose a standardized protocol to improve reproducibility.

A     I MPLEMENTATION D ETAILS
Training Hyperparamters. RF-DETR extends LW-DETR (Chen et al., 2024a) for Neural Archi-
tecture Search. We highlight key differences in our training procedure below. First, we pseudo-label
Objects-365 (Shao et al., 2019) with SAM2 (Ravi et al., 2024) to allow us to pre-train the segmenta-
tion and detection heads on the same data. We use a learning rate of 1e-4 (LW-DETR uses 4e-4), and
a batch size of 128 (LW-DETR uses the same). Similar to DINOv3 (Siméoni et al., 2025), we use
an EMA scheduler since this is necessary for EMA to function. However, unlike DINOv3, we omit
learning-rate warm-up. We clip all gradients greater than 0.1 and apply a per-layer multiplicative
decay of 0.8 to preserve information (especially the earlier layers) in the DINOv2 backbone. We
place our window attention blocks between layers {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10}, while LW-DETR places
their window attention blocks between layers {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9}. Although we have the same number
of windows, contiguous windowed blocks don’t require an additional reshape operation, making our
implementation slightly more efficient. Further, we train with more multi-scale resolutions (0.5 to
1.5 scale) than LW-DETR (0.7 to 1.4 scale) to ensure that the augmentation is symmetric around the
default scale. Notably, we add resolution as a “tunable knob” in our NAS search space, while LW-
DETR uses it as a form of data augmentation. Our model training and inference code is available on
GitHub.
Latency Evaluation. We ensure fair evaluation between models by measuring detection accuracy
and latency using the same artifact. To further standardize inference, we employ CUDA graphs
in TensorRT, which pre-queue all kernels rather than requiring the CPU to launch them serially
during execution. This optimization can accelerate some networks depending on the number and
type of kernels used by the model. We observe that RT-DETR, LW-DETR, and RF-DETR benefit
from this optimization. Further, CUDA graphs place LW-DETR on the same latency-accuracy curve
as D-FINE, since CUDA graphs speed up LW-DETR but do not benefit D-FINE. We release our
stand-alone latency benchmarking tool on GitHub.
Pareto-Optimal Model Configurations in COCO. We present the Pareto-Optimal RF-DETR and
RF-DETR-Seg configurations in Tables 7 and 8. We highlight notable trends about RF-DETR’s
Pareto-Optimal architectures in Appendix L.

Parameter Sampling Grid. Lastly, we present our sampling grid for training and inference below.
Importantly, we only drop decoder layers and queries during inference. We uniformly sample con-
figurations during training and perform grid search over all configurations during inference to find
Pareto-Optimal model configurations. RF-DETRs total training time is roughly two to four times as
long as a non-NAS baseline, depending on the target dataset. However, RF-DETR can generate all
size configurations from this single training run, while other non-NAS baselines must be re-trained
for each new model size. We evaluate 6,468 network configurations (11 resolutions * 7 patch sizes
* 7 decoder layers * 3 windows * 4 query settings) during architecture search. We estimate that this
search takes approximately 10,000 GPU Hours (200 T4 GPUs * 48 hours).

B    A BLATION ON Q UERY T OKENS AND D ECODER L AYERS

Figure 4: Impact of Decoder Layers vs. Query Tokens. We evaluate the impact of inference-time
query dropping for trading-off accuracy and latency in RF-DETR (nano). Interestingly, we find that
dropping the 100 lowest confidence queries does not significantly reduce performance, but modestly
improves latency for all decoder layers.

We train RF-DETR (nano) with 300 object queries, following standard practices for real-time
DETR-based object detectors. However, many datasets contain fewer than 300 objects per im-
age. Therefore, processing all 300 queries can be computationally wasteful. LW-DETR (tiny)
demonstrates that training with fewer queries can improve the latency-accuracy tradeoff. Rather
than deciding on the optimal number of queries apriori, we find that we can drop queries at test
time without retraining by discarding the lowest-confidence queries ordered by the confidence of
the corresponding token at the output of the encoder. As shown in Figure 4, this yields meaningful
latency-accuracy tradeoffs. In addition, prior work (Zhao et al., 2024) demonstrates that decoder
layers can be pruned at test time, since each layer is supervised independently during training. We

                                                 16

find that it is possible to remove all decoder layers, relying solely on the initial query proposals
from the two-stage DETR pipeline. In this case, there is no cross-attention to the encoder states
or self-attention between queries, leading to a substantial runtime reduction. The resulting model
resembles a single-stage YOLO-style architecture without NMS. Eliminating the final decoder layer
reduces latency by 10% with only a 2 mAP drop in performance.

C    B ENCHMARKING FLOP S
We benchmark FLOPs for RF-DETR, GroundingDINO, and LLMDet with PyTorch’s
FlopCounterMode. We find that FlopCounterMode closely reproduces FLOP counts ob-
tained with custom benchmarking tools for YOLOv11, D-FINE, and LW-DETR. In practice, we
also find that it provides more reliable results than CalFLOPs (Ye, 2023). Notably, LW-DETR’s
FLOPs count is roughly twice that of the originally reported result (cf. Table 9). We posit that
this discrepancy can be attributed to LW-DETR reporting MACs instead of FLOPs. We rely on the
officially reported FLOPs counts from YOLOv11, YOLOv8, D-FINE, and RT-DETR.

Table 9: FLOPs Benchmarking Comparison. We compare FLOPs reported with custom bench-
marking tools, CalFLOPs, and PyTorch’s FlopCounterMode. Notably, we find that FlopCounter-
Model closely matches the results reported with custom benchmarking code, suggesting that it is
more reliable than prior generic benchmarking tools.

D    I MPACT OF C LASS -NAMES ON O PEN -VOCABULARY D ETECTORS
We evaluate the impact of fine-tuning open-vocabulary detectors like GroundingDINO with class
names on RF100-VL in Table 10. Intuitively, GroundingDINO’s vision-language pre-training
should be more more useful when we prompt with class names (e.g. car, truck, bus) instead
of class indices (e.g. 0, 1, 2). Using class names when fine-tuning provides more information to
the VLM about the underlying data than is available to non-VLM detectors, potentially leading to
better downstream performance. However, we find that fine-tuning GroundingDINO on RF100-VL
yields nearly identical performance in both cases, suggesting that naively fine-tuning the end-to-end
model mitigates the benefits of open-vocabulary pre-training. Future work should investigate ways
of effectively fine-tuning VLMs to preserve foundational pre-training.

Table 10: Evaluating the Impact of Class Names. We evaluate the impact of using class-names
when fine-tuning VLMs like GroundingDINO. We find that class-names do not provide significant
benefit over prompting with class indices, suggesting that fine-tuning has diminished the impact of
internet-scale pre-training.

E    B ENCHMARKING L ARGER M ODEL VARIANTS
Detectors like LW-DETR (Chen et al., 2024a) and D-FINE (Peng et al., 2024) hand-design larger
variants to scale up a model family. In contrast, NAS-based architectures like RF-DETR automati-
cally discover scaling strategies through grid-based search. We analyze two families of RF-DETR
models derived from distinct scaling strategies: one based on a DINOv2-S backbone and another
based on a DINOv2-B backbone. To evaluate how well each family scales, we compare their NAS-
generated Pareto curves against those of D-FINE. Specifically, at each D-FINE size, we identify the
RF-DETR variant with the same backbone that maximizes performance at a comparable latency.
For example, when comparing to D-FINE (small), we select the RF-DETR model that offers the

Table 11: mAP@50:95 Gap of RF-DETR vs D-FINE at Similar Latencies We compare how
different RF-DETR model families scale relative to D-FINE. D-FINE (nano) is excluded since it
was not pretrained on Objects-365 and is therefore not expected to follow similar scaling trends. For
each RF-DETR backbone, we select the highest accuracy Pareto-optimal NAS-mined model with
latency up to that of the corresponding D-FINE variant. Notably, RF-DETR (DINOv2-B) achieves
better scalability than RF-DETR (DINOv2-S) and D-FINE. Note that none of the RF-DETR models
for COCO are finetuned.

best accuracy without exceeding D-FINE (small)’s latency. Note that these RF-DETRmodels are
different than those reported in Tables 2 and 12.
As shown in Table 11, the DINOv2-S backbone family initially surpasses D-FINE in mAP@50:95
but fails to maintain this advantage at larger model sizes, suggesting that its scaling strategy is less
effective than D-FINE’s manual design. In contrast, the DINOv2-B backbone family shows the
opposite trend, where the performance gap between D-FINE and RF-DETR narrows as latency in-
creases. This implies that at higher latencies, the DINOv2-B based RF-DETR models could surpass
D-FINE (and indeed RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms D-FINE on mAP 50:95). Importantly, ex-
panding the D-FINE model family would require substantial additional engineering effort, whereas
extending the RF-DETR model family is straightforward; higher-latency variants can be sampled di-
rectly from the same NAS search without re-training. We present the COCO and RF100-VL results
of our larger variants in Tables 12, 13, and 14. We also include an RF-DETR Max variant on each
dataset to show our method’s maximum performance with latency less than 100ms, a scale other
model families don’t reach.

We evaluate the impact of varying resolution and patch size in Figure 5. Both curves follow a clear
Pareto frontier, and are consistent with findings from prior work like FlexiViT (Beyer et al., 2023).
RF-DETR is able to gracefully interpolate between seen (blue circles) and unseen (red stars) config-
urations during inference. Importantly, unseen configurations closely track the trend established by
the seen configurations, demonstrating that RF-DETR generalizes beyond the model configurations
encountered during training.

G    I MPACT OF NAS F INE -T UNING ON COCO

We find that fine-tuning after NAS provides limited benefit for COCO. We posit that the NAS “archi-
tecture augmentation” acts as a strong regularizer, and additional training without this regularization
leads to degraded performance. Specifically, when models are pre-trained with strong regularization,
removing the regularization during fine-tuning leads to overfitting. As shown in Tables 15 and 16,
this trend is consistent across both detection and segmentation tasks. Interestingly, models trained
on RF100-VL benefit more from fine-tuning, likely because they require more than 100 epochs to

RF-DETR is able to gracefully interpolate to novel model configurations.

converge. In such cases, we posit that reducing the total number of NAS configurations during
training, or training for more than 100 epochs with weight-sharing NAS can improve performance.

limited benefit for COCO detection, particularly for larger model sizes.

H    I MPACT OF DATASET C HARACTERISTICS ON T UNABLE K NOBS
We evaluate the impact of different dataset characteristics on optimal network configurations for
RF-DETR (medium) on RF100-VL in Table 17 and Figure 6. We compare different combinations
of object size, number of spatial locations, number of decoder layers, number of windows, number
of classes, number of annotations, objects per image, and number of queries below. We do not
expect these relationships to be linear, but expect that they will be monotonic (e.g. non-zero slope).
For example, we find strong correlations between the number of classes and number of decoder
layers, objects per image and number of queries, spatial locations and number of windows. Notably,
we do not find strong correlations between object size and number of decoder layers, number of
annotations and number of decoder layers, and objects per image and number of decoder layers

Table 17: Regression Analysis. We evaluate the linear relationships between various dataset charac-
teristics and model parameters. Although these correlations are non-linear, the line-of-best-fit helps
explain general trends. P-values indicate the significance of the correlation.

Figure 6: Impact of Dataset Characteristics on Tunable Knobs. We visualize the correlation
between key dataset characteristics and several tunable architectural knobs above. Across all sub-
plots, individual points represent different datasets within RF100-VL while dashed lines show cor-
responding linear trends. Overall, the results indicate that object-centric properties of datasets such
as average object size, number of classes, object density, and total annotations tend to have only
modest influence on architectural choices like the number of decoder layers, number of windows,
number of queries, and spatial resolution. Slight positive or negative trends appear in some cases
(e.g., more classes or more objects per image loosely correlating with deeper decoders or higher
query counts), but the scatter remains wide, suggesting no strong deterministic relationship. These
findings highlight that while dataset characteristics offer some intuition for selecting model hyper-
parameters, optimal configurations ultimately depend on a combination of factors rather than any
single dataset attribute.

I      I MPACT OF F IXED A RCHITECTURE ON RF100-VL
We evaluate the impact of transferring a NAS architecture optimized for COCO to RF100-VL in
Table 18 and Figure 7. We find that these fixed architecture models perform remarkably well
without further dataset-specific NAS. Specifically, RF-DETR (large) model with a fixed architec-
ture achieves the best performance among all prior real-time models on COCO. However, dataset-
specific NAS yields significant improvements. Notably, the performance delta from LW-DETR to
the fixed architecture is comparable to the improvement from the fixed architecture to the NAS-
optimized model on the target dataset for nano, small, and medium scale models.

                                                               specific NAS by transferring the COCO-
                                                               optimized RF-DETR architecture to RF100-VL.
                                                               Although the fixed architecture was not tuned
                                                               for RF100-VL, it still outperforms LW-DETR.
                                                               Running NAS directly on RF100-VL further
                                                               improves performance over the fixed architec-
                                                               ture. Additional fine-tuning provides consistent
                                                               gains across all model sizes, with particularly
                                                               strong improvements for smaller models. This
                                                               is consistent with our observations on COCO

Table 18: RF100-VL Fixed Architecture Evaluation. We evaluate the transfer of architectures
optimized for COCO to RF100-VL. Fixed architecture models perform well without additional
dataset-specific NAS, with the RF-DETR (large) model achieving the best performance among prior
real-time models. However, dataset-specific NAS provides significant further gains.

K    A NALYSIS ON B UFFERING
We further analyze the impact of buffering on the relative ordering of inference speed in Table 20.
Notably, we find that buffering beyond 200ms does not change latency measurements. However,
we acknowledge that adding a 200ms buffer after every forward pass considerably increases overall
inference time. Future work should consider alternatives to buffering to address power throttling.

Table 20: Analysis on Buffering. We evaluate models with different amounts of buffering between
consecutive forward passes. We find that buffering beyond 200ms does not provide any additional
stability to latency measurements.

Several trends emerge from our weight-sharing NAS. First, we note that all tunable “knobs” are
used when defining Pareto-optimal model families, validating our search space. This suggests that
expanding the search space may further improve downstream performance.
Across Pareto-optimal models, patch size is consistent within model families. For example, the
optimal patch size for RF-DETRs with a DINOv2-S backbone is 16, RF-DETRs with a DINOv2-B
backbone is 20, and RF-DETR-Segs with a DINOv2-S backbone is 12. Pareto-optimal models also
jointly scale encoder and decoder compute: patch size, number of windows, and resolution impact
the encoder, while decoder depth, and number of queries affect the decoder. For RF-DETR-Seg,
scaling resolution impacts the segmentation head. We find that using 2 windows in the encoder is
typically optimal and resolution scales within a model family as we increase latency. On COCO,
RF-DETR scales decoder depth while keeping the number of queries fixed, while RF-DETR-Seg
simultaneously scales both axes. This likely reflects a minimum viable segmentation head depth; to
offset its latency, RF-DETR-Seg reduces its total number of queries, yielding a thin, deep decoder,
in contrast to RF-DETRs wide, shallow decoder.
Next, we find that RF-DETR’s performance is more correlated with the total number of spatial
locations (e.g. resolution divided by patch size) rather than resolution or patch size alone. Scaling
resolution with a fixed patch size yields similar results to scaling patch size with a fixed resolution,
since vision transformers are agnostic to absolute input resolution after the patchify-and-project
operation. To verify this, we constructed an alternative model family with fixed resolution (640)
and varied patch sizes to preserve the total number of spatial locations. Specifically, we evaluate
RF-DETR (nano) with a patch size of 27, RF-DETR (small) with a patch size of 21, and RF-DETR
(medium) with a patch size of 18. Surprisingly, all model results are nearly identical to the Pareto-
optimal family. Notably, patch sizes of 27 and 18 were unseen during training, demonstrating RF-
DETR’s strong generalization to novel patch sizes (Beyer et al., 2023). However, we find that
this trend does not hold for RF-DETR-Seg because segmentation features are always upsampled
to 14 of the input image resolution. As a result, scaling RF-DETR-Seg’s input resolution affects
both the number of spatial locations and the segmentation feature resolution. Specifically, RF-
DETR-Seg (nano, small, medium) uses input resolutions of 312, 384, and 432 with patch size 12,
yielding segmentation feature resolutions of 78, 96, and 108 and 26, 32, and 36 spatial locations,
respectively. In contrast, increasing patch size alone (e.g., patch size 16 at input resolution 576)
preserves spatial locations while increasing segmentation feature resolution. As a result, although
RF-DETR (medium) and RF-DETR-Seg (medium) both use 36 spatial locations, RF-DETR-Seg
operates at lower input resolution, demonstrating that coupling segmentation feature resolution with
input resolution shifts the Pareto-optimal operating point.
Further, we find that most Pareto-optimal RF-DETR models perform best with 2 windows, whereas
LW-DETR achieves the best performance with 4 windows. We attribute this difference to how each
architecture handles class tokens. LW-DETRs CAEv2 backbone omits the class token, while RF-

DETR’s DINOv2 backbone relies on it as a key part of pre-training. To make windowed attention
compatible with class tokens, we duplicate the class token for each window. During global attention,
window-level class tokens attend to one another, while all other tokens attend to all class tokens. In
practice, RF-DETR (nano), RF-DETR (small), and RF-DETR (medium) all use 2 windows, since
duplicating class tokens for additional windows reduces runtime efficiency. As a result, unlike LW-
DETR, RF-DETR does not benefit from scaling to 4 windows.
Lastly, we note that dataset characteristics influence optimal discovered architectures. We find that
the optimal low latency models on RF100-VL tend to use fewer queries than the COCO models
of equivalent latency. We attribute this to RF100-VL datasets having fewer objects per image than
COCO.

We visualize model predictions from RF-DETR (nano) and relevant detection and segmentation
baselines in Figure 8. We find that RF-DETR (nano) predicts fewer false positives (e.g. mistaking
sign post for person). Similarly, RF-DETR-Seg. (nano) predicts more precise object bound-
aries.
