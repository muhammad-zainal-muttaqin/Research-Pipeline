                                                       DETR has been recently proposed to eliminate the need for many hand-designed
                                                       components in object detection while demonstrating good performance. However,
                                                       it suffers from slow convergence and limited feature spatial resolution, due to the
                                                       limitation of Transformer attention modules in processing image feature maps. To
                                                       mitigate these issues, we proposed Deformable DETR, whose attention modules
                                                       only attend to a small set of key sampling points around a reference. Deformable
                                                       DETR can achieve better performance than DETR (especially on small objects)
                                                       with 10× less training epochs. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark
                                                       demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is released at https://

                                         1        I NTRODUCTION

                                         Modern object detectors employ many hand-crafted components (Liu et al., 2020), e.g., anchor gen-
                                         eration, rule-based training target assignment, non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing.
                                         They are not fully end-to-end. Recently, Carion et al. (2020) proposed DETR to eliminate the need
                                         for such hand-crafted components, and built the first fully end-to-end object detector, achieving very
                                         competitive performance. DETR utilizes a simple architecture, by combining convolutional neural
                                         networks (CNNs) and Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) encoder-decoders. They exploit the ver-
                                         satile and powerful relation modeling capability of Transformers to replace the hand-crafted rules,
                                         under properly designed training signals.
                                         Despite its interesting design and good performance, DETR has its own issues: (1) It requires
                                         much longer training epochs to converge than the existing object detectors. For example, on the
                                         COCO (Lin et al., 2014) benchmark, DETR needs 500 epochs to converge, which is around 10 to 20
                                         times slower than Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015). (2) DETR delivers relatively low performance
                                         at detecting small objects. Modern object detectors usually exploit multi-scale features, where small
                                         objects are detected from high-resolution feature maps. Meanwhile, high-resolution feature maps
                                         lead to unacceptable complexities for DETR. The above-mentioned issues can be mainly attributed
                                         to the deficit of Transformer components in processing image feature maps. At initialization, the
                                         attention modules cast nearly uniform attention weights to all the pixels in the feature maps. Long
                                         training epoches is necessary for the attention weights to be learned to focus on sparse meaning-
                                         ful locations. On the other hand, the attention weights computation in Transformer encoder is of
                                         quadratic computation w.r.t. pixel numbers. Thus, it is of very high computational and memory
                                         complexities to process high-resolution feature maps.
                                         In the image domain, deformable convolution (Dai et al., 2017) is of a powerful and efficient mech-
                                         anism to attend to sparse spatial locations. It naturally avoids the above-mentioned issues. While it
                                         lacks the element relation modeling mechanism, which is the key for the success of DETR.

In this paper, we propose Deformable DETR, which mitigates the slow convergence and high com-
plexity issues of DETR. It combines the best of the sparse spatial sampling of deformable convo-
lution, and the relation modeling capability of Transformers. We propose the deformable attention
module, which attends to a small set of sampling locations as a pre-filter for prominent key elements
out of all the feature map pixels. The module can be naturally extended to aggregating multi-scale
features, without the help of FPN (Lin et al., 2017a). In Deformable DETR , we utilize (multi-scale)
deformable attention modules to replace the Transformer attention modules processing feature maps,
as shown in Fig. 1.
Deformable DETR opens up possibilities for us to exploit variants of end-to-end object detectors,
thanks to its fast convergence, and computational and memory efficiency. We explore a simple and
effective iterative bounding box refinement mechanism to improve the detection performance. We
also try a two-stage Deformable DETR, where the region proposals are also generated by a vaiant of
Deformable DETR, which are further fed into the decoder for iterative bounding box refinement.
Extensive experiments on the COCO (Lin et al., 2014) benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach. Compared with DETR, Deformable DETR can achieve better performance (es-
pecially on small objects) with 10× less training epochs. The proposed variant of two-stage De-
formable DETR can further improve the performance. Code is released at https://github.

2   R ELATED W ORK

Efficient Attention Mechanism. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) involve both self-attention
and cross-attention mechanisms. One of the most well-known concern of Transformers is the high
time and memory complexity at vast key element numbers, which hinders model scalability in many
cases. Recently, many efforts have been made to address this problem (Tay et al., 2020b), which can
be roughly divided into three categories in practice.
The first category is to use pre-defined sparse attention patterns on keys. The most straightforward
paradigm is restricting the attention pattern to be fixed local windows. Most works (Liu et al.,
2018a; Parmar et al., 2018; Child et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Ho et al., 2019; Wang et al.,
2020a; Hu et al., 2019; Ramachandran et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020; Ainslie
et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020) follow this paradigm. Although restricting the attention pattern
to a local neighborhood can decrease the complexity, it loses global information. To compensate,
Child et al. (2019); Huang et al. (2019); Ho et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2020a) attend key elements

at fixed intervals to significantly increase the receptive field on keys. Beltagy et al. (2020); Ainslie
et al. (2020); Zaheer et al. (2020) allow a small number of special tokens having access to all key
elements. Zaheer et al. (2020); Qiu et al. (2019) also add some pre-fixed sparse attention patterns to
attend distant key elements directly.
The second category is to learn data-dependent sparse attention. Kitaev et al. (2020) proposes a
locality sensitive hashing (LSH) based attention, which hashes both the query and key elements to
different bins. A similar idea is proposed by Roy et al. (2020), where k-means finds out the most
related keys. Tay et al. (2020a) learns block permutation for block-wise sparse attention.
The third category is to explore the low-rank property in self-attention. Wang et al. (2020b) reduces
the number of key elements through a linear projection on the size dimension instead of the channel
dimension. Katharopoulos et al. (2020); Choromanski et al. (2020) rewrite the calculation of self-
attention through kernelization approximation.
In the image domain, the designs of efficient attention mechanism (e.g., Parmar et al. (2018); Child
et al. (2019); Huang et al. (2019); Ho et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2020a); Hu et al. (2019); Ramachan-
dran et al. (2019)) are still limited to the first category. Despite the theoretically reduced complexity,
Ramachandran et al. (2019); Hu et al. (2019) admit such approaches are much slower in implemen-
tation than traditional convolution with the same FLOPs (at least 3× slower), due to the intrinsic
limitation in memory access patterns.
On the other hand, as discussed in Zhu et al. (2019a), there are variants of convolution, such as
deformable convolution (Dai et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2019b) and dynamic convolution (Wu et al.,
2019), that also can be viewed as self-attention mechanisms. Especially, deformable convolution
operates much more effectively and efficiently on image recognition than Transformer self-attention.
Meanwhile, it lacks the element relation modeling mechanism.
Our proposed deformable attention module is inspired by deformable convolution, and belongs to
the second category. It only focuses on a small fixed set of sampling points predicted from the
feature of query elements. Different from Ramachandran et al. (2019); Hu et al. (2019), deformable
attention is just slightly slower than the traditional convolution under the same FLOPs.
Multi-scale Feature Representation for Object Detection. One of the main difficulties in object
detection is to effectively represent objects at vastly different scales. Modern object detectors usually
exploit multi-scale features to accommodate this. As one of the pioneering works, FPN (Lin et al.,
2017a) proposes a top-down path to combine multi-scale features. PANet (Liu et al., 2018b) further
adds an bottom-up path on the top of FPN. Kong et al. (2018) combines features from all scales
by a global attention operation. Zhao et al. (2019) proposes a U-shape module to fuse multi-scale
features. Recently, NAS-FPN (Ghiasi et al., 2019) and Auto-FPN (Xu et al., 2019) are proposed
to automatically design cross-scale connections via neural architecture search. Tan et al. (2020)
proposes the BiFPN, which is a repeated simplified version of PANet. Our proposed multi-scale
deformable attention module can naturally aggregate multi-scale feature maps via attention mecha-
nism, without the help of these feature pyramid networks.

3    R EVISITING T RANSFORMERS AND DETR

Multi-Head Attention in Transformers. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) are of a network
architecture based on attention mechanisms for machine translation. Given a query element (e.g.,
a target word in the output sentence) and a set of key elements (e.g., source words in the input
sentence), the multi-head attention module adaptively aggregates the key contents according to the
attention weights that measure the compatibility of query-key pairs. To allow the model focusing
on contents from different representation subspaces and different positions, the outputs of different
attention heads are linearly aggregated with learnable weights. Let q ∈ Ωq indexes a query element
with representation feature zq ∈ RC , and k ∈ Ωk indexes a key element with representation feature
xk ∈ RC , where C is the feature dimension, Ωq and Ωk specify the set of query and key elements,
respectively. Then the multi-head attention feature is calculated by
                                                 M
                                                 X            X            0

                                                                               } are normalized as

P
   k∈Ωk Amqk = 1, in which Um , Vm ∈ R                are also learnable weights. To disambiguate
different spatial positions, the representation features zq and xk are usually of the concatena-
tion/summation of element contents and positional embeddings.
There are two known issues with Transformers. One is Transformers need long training schedules
before convergence. Suppose the number of query and key elements are of Nq and Nk , respectively.
Typically, with proper parameter initialization, Um zq and Vm xk follow distribution with mean of
0 and variance of 1, which makes attention weights Amqk ≈ N1k , when Nk is large. It will lead
to ambiguous gradients for input features. Thus, long training schedules are required so that the
attention weights can focus on specific keys. In the image domain, where the key elements are
usually of image pixels, Nk can be very large and the convergence is tedious.
On the other hand, the computational and memory complexity for multi-head attention can be
very high with numerous query and key elements. The computational complexity of Eq. 1 is of
O(Nq C 2 + Nk C 2 + Nq Nk C). In the image domain, where the query and key elements are both of
pixels, Nq = Nk  C, the complexity is dominated by the third term, as O(Nq Nk C). Thus, the
multi-head attention module suffers from a quadratic complexity growth with the feature map size.
DETR. DETR (Carion et al., 2020) is built upon the Transformer encoder-decoder architecture,
combined with a set-based Hungarian loss that forces unique predictions for each ground-truth
bounding box via bipartite matching. We briefly review the network architecture as follows.
Given the input feature maps x ∈ RC×H×W extracted by a CNN backbone (e.g., ResNet (He et al.,
2016)), DETR exploits a standard Transformer encoder-decoder architecture to transform the input
feature maps to be features of a set of object queries. A 3-layer feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and a linear projection are added on top of the object query features (produced by the decoder) as
the detection head. The FFN acts as the regression branch to predict the bounding box coordinates
b ∈ [0, 1]4 , where b = {bx , by , bw , bh } encodes the normalized box center coordinates, box height
and width (relative to the image size). The linear projection acts as the classification branch to
produce the classification results.
For the Transformer encoder in DETR, both query and key elements are of pixels in the feature maps.
The inputs are of ResNet feature maps (with encoded positional embeddings). Let H and W denote
the feature map height and width, respectively. The computational complexity of self-attention is of
O(H 2 W 2 C), which grows quadratically with the spatial size.
For the Transformer decoder in DETR, the input includes both feature maps from the encoder, and
N object queries represented by learnable positional embeddings (e.g., N = 100). There are two
types of attention modules in the decoder, namely, cross-attention and self-attention modules. In the
cross-attention modules, object queries extract features from the feature maps. The query elements
are of the object queries, and key elements are of the output feature maps from the encoder. In it,
Nq = N , Nk = H × W and the complexity of the cross-attention is of O(HW C 2 + N HW C).
The complexity grows linearly with the spatial size of feature maps. In the self-attention modules,
object queries interact with each other, so as to capture their relations. The query and key elements
are both of the object queries. In it, Nq = Nk = N , and the complexity of the self-attention module
is of O(2N C 2 + N 2 C). The complexity is acceptable with moderate number of object queries.
DETR is an attractive design for object detection, which removes the need for many hand-designed
components. However, it also has its own issues. These issues can be mainly attributed to the
deficits of Transformer attention in handling image feature maps as key elements: (1) DETR has
relatively low performance in detecting small objects. Modern object detectors use high-resolution
feature maps to better detect small objects. However, high-resolution feature maps would lead to an
unacceptable complexity for the self-attention module in the Transformer encoder of DETR, which
has a quadratic complexity with the spatial size of input feature maps. (2) Compared with modern
object detectors, DETR requires many more training epochs to converge. This is mainly because
the attention modules processing image features are difficult to train. For example, at initialization,
the cross-attention modules are almost of average attention on the whole feature maps. While, at
the end of the training, the attention maps are learned to be very sparse, focusing only on the object

Deformable Attention Module. The core issue of applying Transformer attention on image feature
maps is that it would look over all possible spatial locations. To address this, we present a deformable
attention module. Inspired by deformable convolution (Dai et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2019b), the
deformable attention module only attends to a small set of key sampling points around a reference
point, regardless of the spatial size of the feature maps, as shown in Fig. 2. By assigning only a
small fixed number of keys for each query, the issues of convergence and feature spatial resolution
can be mitigated.
Given an input feature map x ∈ RC×H×W , let q index a query element with content feature zq and
a 2-d reference point pq , the deformable attention feature is calculated by
                                                                         M
                                                                         X                K
                                                                                         X                0
                                                                                                                           
                           DeformAttn(zq , pq , x) =                            Wm                 Amqk · Wm x(pq + ∆pmqk ) ,                           (2)
                                                                      m=1                    k=1

where m indexes the attention head, k indexes the sampled keys, and K is the total sampled key
number (K  HW ). ∆pmqk and Amqk denote the sampling offset and attention weight of the
k th sampling point in the mth attention head, respectively. The scalar attention weight Amqk lies
                                   PK
in the range [0, 1], normalized by k=1 Amqk = 1. ∆pmqk ∈ R2 are of 2-d real numbers with
unconstrained range. As pq + ∆pmqk is fractional, bilinear interpolation is applied as in Dai et al.
(2017) in computing x(pq +∆pmqk ). Both ∆pmqk and Amqk are obtained via linear projection over
the query feature zq . In implementation, the query feature zq is fed to a linear projection operator
of 3M K channels, where the first 2M K channels encode the sampling offsets ∆pmqk , and the
remaining M K channels are fed to a softmax operator to obtain the attention weights Amqk .
The deformable attention module is designed for processing convolutional feature maps as key ele-
ments. Let Nq be the number of query elements, when M K is relatively small, the complexity of the
deformable attention module is of O(2Nq C 2 + min(HW C 2 , Nq KC 2 )) (See Appendix A.1 for de-
tails). When it is applied in DETR encoder, where Nq = HW , the complexity becomes O(HW C 2 ),
which is of linear complexity with the spatial size. When it is applied as the cross-attention modules

                                                                                         5

in DETR decoder, where Nq = N (N is the number of object queries), the complexity becomes
O(N KC 2 ), which is irrelevant to the spatial size HW .
Multi-scale Deformable Attention Module. Most modern object detection frameworks benefit
from multi-scale feature maps (Liu et al., 2020). Our proposed deformable attention module can be
naturally extended for multi-scale feature maps.
                                                                 C×Hl ×Wl

         l=1 be the input multi-scale feature maps, where x ∈ R           . Let p̂q ∈ [0, 1]2 be
the normalized coordinates of the reference point for each query element q, then the multi-scale
deformable attention module is applied as

                                        m=1        l=1 k=1

where m indexes the attention head, l indexes the input feature level, and k indexes the sampling
point. ∆pmlqk and Amlqk denote the sampling offset and attention weight of the k th sampling point
in the lth feature level and the mth attention head, respectively. The scalar attention weight Amlqk
                    PL PK
is normalized by l=1 k=1 Amlqk = 1. Here, we use normalized coordinates p̂q ∈ [0, 1]2 for
the clarity of scale formulation, in which the normalized coordinates (0, 0) and (1, 1) indicate the
top-left and the bottom-right image corners, respectively. Function φl (p̂q ) in Equation 3 re-scales
the normalized coordinates p̂q to the input feature map of the l-th level. The multi-scale deformable
attention is very similar to the previous single-scale version, except that it samples LK points from
multi-scale feature maps instead of K points from single-scale feature maps.
The proposed attention module will degenerate to deformable convolution (Dai et al., 2017), when
                           0
L = 1, K = 1, and Wm         ∈ RCv ×C is fixed as an identity matrix. Deformable convolution is
designed for single-scale inputs, focusing only on one sampling point for each attention head. How-
ever, our multi-scale deformable attention looks over multiple sampling points from multi-scale in-
puts. The proposed (multi-scale) deformable attention module can also be perceived as an efficient
variant of Transformer attention, where a pre-filtering mechanism is introduced by the deformable
sampling locations. When the sampling points traverse all possible locations, the proposed attention
module is equivalent to Transformer attention.
Deformable Transformer Encoder. We replace the Transformer attention modules processing
feature maps in DETR with the proposed multi-scale deformable attention module. Both the input
and output of the encoder are of multi-scale feature maps with the same resolutions. In encoder, we
                                      L−1
extract multi-scale feature maps {xl }l=1 (L = 4) from the output feature maps of stages C3 through
C5 in ResNet (He et al., 2016) (transformed by a 1 × 1 convolution), where Cl is of resolution 2l
lower than the input image. The lowest resolution feature map xL is obtained via a 3 × 3 stride 2
convolution on the final C5 stage, denoted as C6 . All the multi-scale feature maps are of C = 256
channels. Note that the top-down structure in FPN (Lin et al., 2017a) is not used, because our
proposed multi-scale deformable attention in itself can exchange information among multi-scale
feature maps. The constructing of multi-scale feature maps are also illustrated in Appendix A.2.
Experiments in Section 5.2 show that adding FPN will not improve the performance.
In application of the multi-scale deformable attention module in encoder, the output are of multi-
scale feature maps with the same resolutions as the input. Both the key and query elements are
of pixels from the multi-scale feature maps. For each query pixel, the reference point is itself. To
identify which feature level each query pixel lies in, we add a scale-level embedding, denoted as el ,
to the feature representation, in addition to the positional embedding. Different from the positional
embedding with fixed encodings, the scale-level embedding {el }L     l=1 are randomly initialized and
jointly trained with the network.
Deformable Transformer Decoder. There are cross-attention and self-attention modules in the
decoder. The query elements for both types of attention modules are of object queries. In the cross-
attention modules, object queries extract features from the feature maps, where the key elements are
of the output feature maps from the encoder. In the self-attention modules, object queries interact
with each other, where the key elements are of the object queries. Since our proposed deformable
attention module is designed for processing convolutional feature maps as key elements, we only
replace each cross-attention module to be the multi-scale deformable attention module, while leaving
the self-attention modules unchanged. For each object query, the 2-d normalized coordinate of the

reference point p̂q is predicted from its object query embedding via a learnable linear projection
followed by a sigmoid function.
Because the multi-scale deformable attention module extracts image features around the reference
point, we let the detection head predict the bounding box as relative offsets w.r.t. the reference
point to further reduce the optimization difficulty. The reference point is used as the initial guess
of the box center. The detection head predicts the relative offsets w.r.t. the reference point. Check
Appendix A.3 for the details. In this way, the learned decoder attention will have strong correlation
with the predicted bounding boxes, which also accelerates the training convergence.
By replacing Transformer attention modules with deformable attention modules in DETR, we es-
tablish an efficient and fast converging detection system, dubbed as Deformable DETR (see Fig. 1).

4.2   A DDITIONAL I MPROVEMENTS AND VARIANTS FOR D EFORMABLE DETR

Deformable DETR opens up possibilities for us to exploit various variants of end-to-end object de-
tectors, thanks to its fast convergence, and computational and memory efficiency. Due to limited
space, we only introduce the core ideas of these improvements and variants here. The implementa-
tion details are given in Appendix A.4.
Iterative Bounding Box Refinement. This is inspired by the iterative refinement developed in
optical flow estimation (Teed & Deng, 2020). We establish a simple and effective iterative bounding
box refinement mechanism to improve detection performance. Here, each decoder layer refines the
bounding boxes based on the predictions from the previous layer.
Two-Stage Deformable DETR. In the original DETR, object queries in the decoder are irrelevant
to the current image. Inspired by two-stage object detectors, we explore a variant of Deformable
DETR for generating region proposals as the first stage. The generated region proposals will be fed
into the decoder as object queries for further refinement, forming a two-stage Deformable DETR.
In the first stage, to achieve high-recall proposals, each pixel in the multi-scale feature maps would
serve as an object query. However, directly setting object queries as pixels will bring unacceptable
computational and memory cost for the self-attention modules in the decoder, whose complexity
grows quadratically with the number of queries. To avoid this problem, we remove the decoder and
form an encoder-only Deformable DETR for region proposal generation. In it, each pixel is assigned
as an object query, which directly predicts a bounding box. Top scoring bounding boxes are picked
as region proposals. No NMS is applied before feeding the region proposals to the second stage.

Dataset. We conduct experiments on COCO 2017 dataset (Lin et al., 2014). Our models are trained
on the train set, and evaluated on the val set and test-dev set.
Implementation Details. ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) pre-trained ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016)
is utilized as the backbone for ablations. Multi-scale feature maps are extracted without FPN (Lin
et al., 2017a). M = 8 and K = 4 are set for deformable attentions by default. Parameters of the
deformable Transformer encoder are shared among different feature levels. Other hyper-parameter
setting and training strategy mainly follow DETR (Carion et al., 2020), except that Focal Loss (Lin
et al., 2017b) with loss weight of 2 is used for bounding box classification, and the number of
object queries is increased from 100 to 300. We also report the performance of DETR-DC5 with
these modifications for a fair comparison, denoted as DETR-DC5+ . By default, models are trained
for 50 epochs and the learning rate is decayed at the 40-th epoch by a factor of 0.1. Following
DETR(Carion et al., 2020), we train our models using Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with
base learning rate of 2 × 10−4 , β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, and weight decay of 10−4 . Learning rates
of the linear projections, used for predicting object query reference points and sampling offsets, are
multiplied by a factor of 0.1. Run time is evaluated on NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU.

5.1   C OMPARISON WITH DETR

As shown in Table 1, compared with Faster R-CNN + FPN, DETR requires many more training
epochs to converge, and delivers lower performance at detecting small objects. Compared with

DETR, Deformable DETR achieves better performance (especially on small objects) with 10× less
training epochs. Detailed convergence curves are shown in Fig. 3. With the aid of iterative bounding
box refinement and two-stage paradigm, our method can further improve the detection accuracy.
Our proposed Deformable DETR has on par FLOPs with Faster R-CNN + FPN and DETR-DC5.
But the runtime speed is much faster (1.6×) than DETR-DC5, and is just 25% slower than Faster
R-CNN + FPN. The speed issue of DETR-DC5 is mainly due to the large amount of memory access
in Transformer attention. Our proposed deformable attention can mitigate this issue, at the cost of
unordered memory access. Thus, it is still slightly slower than traditional convolution.

5.2    A BLATION S TUDY ON D EFORMABLE ATTENTION

Table 2 presents ablations for various design choices of the proposed deformable attention module.
Using multi-scale inputs instead of single-scale inputs can effectively improve detection accuracy
with 1.7% AP, especially on small objects with 2.9% APS . Increasing the number of sampling points
K can further improve 0.9% AP. Using multi-scale deformable attention, which allows information
exchange among different scale levels, can bring additional 1.5% improvement in AP. Because the
cross-level feature exchange is already adopted, adding FPNs will not improve the performance.
When multi-scale attention is not applied, and K = 1, our (multi-scale) deformable attention module
degenerates to deformable convolution, delivering noticeable lower accuracy.

5.3    C OMPARISON WITH S TATE - OF - THE - ART M ETHODS

Table 3 compares the proposed method with other state-of-the-art methods. Iterative bounding box
refinement and two-stage mechanism are both utilized by our models in Table 3. With ResNet-101
and ResNeXt-101 (Xie et al., 2017), our method achieves 48.7 AP and 49.0 AP without bells and
whistles, respectively. By using ResNeXt-101 with DCN (Zhu et al., 2019b), the accuracy rises to
50.1 AP. With additional test-time augmentations, the proposed method achieves 52.3 AP.

6   C ONCLUSION

Deformable DETR is an end-to-end object detector, which is efficient and fast-converging. It enables
us to explore more interesting and practical variants of end-to-end object detectors. At the core of
Deformable DETR are the (multi-scale) deformable attention modules, which is an efficient attention
mechanism in processing image feature maps. We hope our work opens up new possibilities in
exploring end-to-end object detection.

A.1    C OMPLEXITY FOR D EFORMABLE ATTENTION

Supposes the number of query elements is Nq , in the deformable attention module (see Equation 2),
the complexity for calculating the sampling coordinate offsets ∆pmqk and attention weights Amqk
is of O(3Nq CM K). Given the sampling coordinate offsets and attention weights, the complexity
of computing Equation 2 is O(Nq C 2 + Nq KC 2 + 5Nq KC), where the factor of 5 in 5Nq KC
is because of bilinear interpolation and the weighted sum in attention. On the other hand, we can
                  0
also calculate Wm   x before sampling, as it is independent to query, and the complexity of computing
Equation 2 will become as O(Nq C 2 +HW C 2 +5Nq KC). So the overall complexity of deformable
attention is O(Nq C 2 + min(HW C 2 , Nq KC 2 ) + 5Nq KC + 3Nq CM K). In our experiments,
M = 8, K ≤ 4 and C = 256 by default, thus 5K + 3M K < C and the complexity is of
O(2Nq C 2 + min(HW C 2 , Nq KC 2 )).

A.2    C ONSTRUCTING M ULT- SCALE F EATURE M APS FOR D EFORMABLE DETR

As discussed in Section 4.1 and illustrated in Figure 4, the input multi-scale feature maps of the
encoder {xl }L−1
              l=1 (L = 4) are extracted from the output feature maps of stages C3 through C5 in
ResNet (He et al., 2016) (transformed by a 1×1 convolution). The lowest resolution feature map xL
is obtained via a 3 × 3 stride 2 convolution on the final C5 stage. Note that FPN (Lin et al., 2017a) is
not used, because our proposed multi-scale deformable attention in itself can exchange information
among multi-scale feature maps.

A.3    B OUNDING B OX P REDICTION IN D EFORMABLE DETR

Since the multi-scale deformable attention module extracts image features around the reference
point, we design the detection head to predict the bounding box as relative offsets w.r.t. the reference
point to further reduce the optimization difficulty. The reference point is used as the initial guess
of the box center. The detection head predicts the relative offsets w.r.t. the reference point p̂q =
(p̂qx , p̂qy ), i.e., b̂q = {σ bqx +σ −1 (p̂qx ) , σ bqy +σ −1 (p̂qy ) , σ(bqw ), σ(bqh )}, where bq{x,y,w,h} ∈
                                                                     

R are predicted by the detection head. σ and σ −1 denote the sigmoid and the inverse sigmoid
function, respectively. The usage of σ and σ −1 is to ensure b̂ is of normalized coordinates, as
b̂q ∈ [0, 1]4 . In this way, the learned decoder attention will have strong correlation with the predicted
bounding boxes, which also accelerates the training convergence.

A.4    M ORE I MPLEMENTATION D ETAILS

Iterative Bounding Box Refinement. Here, each decoder layer refines the bounding boxes based
on the predictions from the previous layer. Suppose there are D number of decoder layers (e.g.,
D = 6), given a normalized bounding box b̂d−1
                                            q  predicted by the (d − 1)-th decoder layer, the d-th

decoder layer refines the box as

b̂dq = {σ(∆bdqx +σ −1 (b̂d−1        d
                         qx )), σ(∆bqy +σ
                                          −1 d−1
                                            (b̂qy )), σ(∆bdqw +σ −1 (b̂d−1        d
                                                                       qw )), σ(∆bqh +σ
                                                                                        −1 d−1
                                                                                          (b̂qh ))},

where d ∈ {1, 2, ..., D}, ∆bdq{x,y,w,h} ∈ R are predicted at the d-th decoder layer. Prediction
heads for different decoder layers do not share parameters. The initial box is set as b̂0qx = p̂qx ,
b̂0qy = p̂qy , b̂0qw = 0.1, and b̂0qh = 0.1. The system is robust to the choice of b0qw and b0qh . We tried
setting them as 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and achieved similar performance. To stabilize training, similar
to Teed & Deng (2020), the gradients only back propagate through ∆bdq{x,y,w,h} , and are blocked at
σ −1 (b̂d−1
        q{x,y,w,h} ).

In iterative bounding box refinement, for the d-th decoder layer, we sample key elements respective
to the box b̂d−1
              q  predicted from the (d − 1)-th decoder layer. For Equation 3 in the cross-attention
                                      d−1 d−1
module of the d-th decoder layer, (b̂qx   , b̂qy ) serves as the new reference point. The sampling
                                                                                 d−1
offset ∆pmlqk is also modulated by the box size, as (∆pmlqkx b̂d−1qw , ∆pmlqky b̂qh ). Such modifi-
cations make the sampling locations related to the center and size of previously predicted boxes.
Two-Stage Deformable DETR. In the first stage, given the output feature maps of the encoder, a
detection head is applied to each pixel. The detection head is of a 3-layer FFN for bounding box
regression, and a linear projection for bounding box binary classification (i.e., foreground and back-
ground), respectively. Let i index a pixel from feature level li ∈ {1, 2, ..., L} with 2-d normalized
coordinates p̂i = (p̂ix , p̂iy ) ∈ [0, 1]2 , its corresponding bounding box is predicted by

b̂i = {σ(∆bix +σ −1 (p̂ix )), σ(∆biy +σ −1 (p̂iy )), σ(∆biw +σ −1 (2li −1 s)), σ(∆bih +σ −1 (2li −1 s))},

where the base object scale s is set as 0.05, ∆bi{x,y,w,h} ∈ R are predicted by the bounding box
regression branch. The Hungarian loss in DETR is used for training the detection head.
Given the predicted bounding boxes in the first stage, top scoring bounding boxes are picked as
region proposals. In the second stage, these region proposals are fed into the decoder as initial boxes
for the iterative bounding box refinement, where the positional embeddings of object queries are set
as positional embeddings of region proposal coordinates.

                 C×Cv
and Wm ∈ R              are randomly initialized. Weight parameters of the linear projection for
predicting Amlqk and ∆pmlqk are initialized to zero. Bias parameters of the linear projection
                                       1
are initialized to make Amlqk = LK         and {∆p1lqk = (−k, −k), ∆p2lqk = (−k, 0), ∆p3lqk =
(−k, k), ∆p4lqk = (0, −k), ∆p5lqk = (0, k), ∆p6lqk = (k, −k), ∆p7lqk = (k, 0), ∆p8lqk =
(k, k)} (k ∈ {1, 2, ...K}) at initialization.
For iterative bounding box refinement, the initialized bias parameters for ∆pmlqk prediction in the
                                     1
decoder are further multiplied with 2K , so that all the sampling points at initialization are within the
corresponding bounding boxes predicted from the previous decoder layer.

A.5    W HAT D EFORMABLE DETR LOOKS AT ?

For studying what Deformable DETR looks at to give final detection result, we draw the gradient
norm of each item in final prediction (i.e., x/y coordinate of object center, width/height of object
bounding box, category score of this object) with respect to each pixel in the image, as shown in
Fig. 5. According to Taylor’s theorem, the gradient norm can reflect how much the output would
be changed relative to the perturbation of the pixel, thus it could show us which pixels the model
mainly relys on for predicting each item.
The visualization indicates that Deformable DETR looks at extreme points of the object to deter-
mine its bounding box, which is similar to the observation in DETR (Carion et al., 2020). More con-
cretely, Deformable DETR attends to left/right boundary of the object for x coordinate and width,
and top/bottom boundary for y coordinate and height. Meanwhile, different to DETR (Carion et al.,
2020), our Deformable DETR also looks at pixels inside the object for predicting its category.

A.6   V ISUALIZATION OF M ULTI - SCALE D EFORMABLE ATTENTION

For better understanding learned multi-scale deformable attention modules, we visualize sampling
points and attention weights of the last layer in encoder and decoder, as shown in Fig. 6. For
readibility, we combine the sampling points and attention weights from feature maps of different
resolutions into one picture.
Similar to DETR (Carion et al., 2020), the instances are already separated in the encoder of De-
formable DETR. While in the decoder, our model is focused on the whole foreground instance
instead of only extreme points as observed in DETR (Carion et al., 2020). Combined with the visu-
               ∂c
alization of k ∂I k in Fig. 5, we can guess the reason is that our Deformable DETR needs not only
extreme points but also interior points to detemine object category. The visualization also demon-
strates that the proposed multi-scale deformable attention module can adapt its sampling points and
attention weights according to different scales and shapes of the foreground object.

point is marked as a filled circle whose color indicates its correspoinding attention weight. The
reference point is shown as green cross marker, which is also equivalent to query point in encoder. In
decoder, the predicted bounding box is shown as a green rectangle and the category and confidence
score are texted just above it.
