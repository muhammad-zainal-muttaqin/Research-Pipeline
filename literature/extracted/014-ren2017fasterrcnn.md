                                         Abstract—State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations.
                                         Advances like SPPnet [1] and Fast R-CNN [2] have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region
                                         proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image
                                         convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional
                                         network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to

                                         generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN
                                         into a single network by sharing their convolutional features—using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with
                                         “attention” mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model [3],

Figure 5: Selected examples of object detection results on the PASCAL VOC 2007 test set using the Faster
R-CNN system. The model is VGG-16 and the training data is 07+12 trainval (73.2% mAP on the 2007 test
set). Our method detects objects of a wide range of scales and aspect ratios. Each output box is associated
with a category label and a softmax score in [0, 1]. A score threshold of 0.6 is used to display these images.
The running time for obtaining these results is 198ms per image, including all steps.

Figure 6: Selected examples of object detection results on the MS COCO test-dev set using the Faster R-CNN
system. The model is VGG-16 and the training data is COCO trainval (42.7% mAP@0.5 on the test-dev set).
Each output box is associated with a category label and a softmax score in [0, 1]. A score threshold of 0.6 is
used to display these images. For each image, one color represents one object category in that image.
